1\. "HE LOVED US", Saint Paul says of Christ (cf. *Rom* 8:37), in order
to make us realize that nothing can ever "separate us" from that love
(*Rom* 8:39). Paul could say this with certainty because Jesus himself
had told his disciples, "I have loved you" (*Jn* 15:9, 12). Even now,
the Lord says to us, "I have called you friends" (*Jn* 15:15). His open
heart has gone before us and waits for us, unconditionally, asking only
to offer us his love and friendship. For "he loved us first" (cf. *1 Jn*
4:10). Because of Jesus, "we have come to know and believe in the love
that God has for us" (*1 Jn* 4:16).

# CHAPTER ONE

## THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HEART

2\. The symbol of the heart has often been used to express the love of
Jesus Christ. Some have questioned whether this symbol is still
meaningful today. Yet living as we do in an age of superficiality,
rushing frenetically from one thing to another without really knowing
why, and ending up as insatiable consumers and slaves to the mechanisms
of a market unconcerned about the deeper meaning of our lives, all of us
need to rediscover the importance of the heart.[^1]


## WHAT DO WE MEAN BY "THE HEART"?

3\. In classical Greek, the word *kardía* denotes the inmost part of
human beings, animals and plants. For Homer, it indicates not only the
centre of the body, but also the human soul and spirit. In the Iliad,
thoughts and feelings proceed from the heart and are closely bound one
to another.[^2] The heart appears as the
locus of desire and the place where important decisions take shape.[^3]
 In Plato, the heart serves, as it
were, to unite the rational and instinctive aspects of the person, since
the impulses of both the higher faculties and the passions were thought
to pass through the veins that converge in the heart.[^4]
 From ancient times, then, there has
been an appreciation of the fact that human beings are not simply a sum
of different skills, but a unity of body and soul with a coordinating
centre that provides a backdrop of meaning and direction to all that a
person experiences.

4\. The Bible tells us that, "the Word of God is living and active\...
it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart" (*Heb*
4:12). In this way, it speaks to us of the heart as a core that lies
hidden beneath all outward appearances, even beneath the superficial
thoughts that can lead us astray. The disciples of Emmaus, on their
mysterious journey in the company of the risen Christ, experienced a
moment of anguish, confusion, despair and disappointment. Yet, beyond
and in spite of this, something was happening deep within them: "Were
not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the
road?" (Lk 24:32).

5\. The heart is also the locus of sincerity, where deceit and disguise
have no place. It usually indicates our true intentions, what we really
think, believe and desire, the "secrets" that we tell no one: in a word,
the naked truth about ourselves. It is the part of us that is neither
appearance or illusion, but is instead authentic, real, entirely "who we
are". That is why Samson, who kept from Delilah the secret of his
strength, was asked by her, "How can you say, 'I love you', when your
heart is not with me?" (*Judg* 16:15). Only when Samson opened his heart
to her, did she realize "that he had told her his whole secret" (*Judg*
16:18).

6\. This interior reality of each person is frequently concealed behind
a great deal of "foliage", which makes it difficult for us not only to
understand ourselves, but even more to know others: "The heart is
devious above all else; it is perverse, who can understand it?" (*Jer*
17:9). We can understand, then, the advice of the Book of Proverbs:
"Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of
life; put away from you crooked speech" (4:23-24). Mere appearances,
dishonesty and deception harm and pervert the heart. Despite our every
attempt to appear as something we are not, our heart is the ultimate
judge, not of what we show or hide from others, but of who we truly are.
It is the basis for any sound life project; nothing worthwhile can be
undertaken apart from the heart. False appearances and untruths
ultimately leave us empty-handed.

7\. As an illustration of this, I would repeat a story I have already
told on another occasion. "For the carnival, when we were children, my
grandmother would make a pastry using a very thin batter. When she
dropped the strips of batter into the oil, they would expand, but then,
when we bit into them, they were empty inside. In the dialect we spoke,
those cookies were called 'lies'... My grandmother explained why: 'Like
lies, they look big, but are empty inside; they are false, unreal'".[^5]


8\. Instead of running after superficial satisfactions and playing a
role for the benefit of others, we would do better to think about the
really important questions in life. Who am I, really? What am I looking
for? What direction do I want to give to my life, my decisions and my
actions? Why and for what purpose am I in this world? How do I want to
look back on my life once it ends? What meaning do I want to give to all
my experiences? Who do I want to be for others? Who am I for God? All
these questions lead us back to the heart.

## RETURNING TO THE HEART

9\. In this "liquid" world of ours, we need to start speaking once more
about the heart and thinking about this place where every person, of
every class and condition, creates a synthesis, where they encounter the
radical source of their strengths, convictions, passions and decisions.
Yet, we find ourselves immersed in societies of serial consumers who
live from day to day, dominated by the hectic pace and bombarded by
technology, lacking in the patience needed to engage in the processes
that an interior life by its very nature requires. In contemporary
society, people "risk losing their centre, the centre of their very
selves".[^6] "Indeed, the men and women
of our time often find themselves confused and torn apart, almost bereft
of an inner principle that can create unity and harmony in their lives
and actions. Models of behaviour that, sadly, are now widespread
exaggerate our rational-technological dimension or, on the contrary,
that of our instincts".[^7] No room is
left for the heart.

10\. The issues raised by today's liquid society are much discussed, but
this depreciation of the deep core of our humanity -- the heart -- has a
much longer history. We find it already present in Hellenic and
pre-Christian rationalism, in post-Christian idealism and in materialism
in its various guises. The heart has been ignored in anthropology, and
the great philosophical tradition finds it a foreign notion, preferring
other concepts such as reason, will or freedom. The very meaning of the
term is imprecise and hard to situate within our human experience.
Perhaps this is due to the difficulty of treating it as a "clear and
distinct idea", or because it entails the question of
self-understanding, where the deepest part of us is also that which is
least known. Even encountering others does not necessarily prove to be a
way of encountering ourselves, inasmuch as our thought patterns are
dominated by an unhealthy individualism. Many people feel safer
constructing their systems of thought in the more readily controllable
domain of intelligence and will. The failure to make room for the heart,
as distinct from our human powers and passions viewed in isolation from
one another, has resulted in a stunting of the idea of a personal
centre, in which love, in the end, is the one reality that can unify all
the others.

11\. If we devalue the heart, we also devalue what it means to speak
from the heart, to act with the heart, to cultivate and heal the heart.
If we fail to appreciate the specificity of the heart, we miss the
messages that the mind alone cannot communicate; we miss out on the
richness of our encounters with others; we miss out on poetry. We also
lose track of history and our own past, since our real personal history
is built with the heart. At the end of our lives, that alone will
matter.

12\. It must be said, then, that we have a heart, a heart that coexists
with other hearts that help to make it a "Thou". Since we cannot develop
this theme at length, we will take a character from one of Dostoevsky's
novels, Nikolai Stavrogin.[^8] Romano
Guardini argues that Stavrogin is the very embodiment of evil, because
his chief trait is his heartlessness: "Stavrogin has no heart, hence his
mind is cold and empty and his body sunken in bestial sloth and
sensuality. He has no heart, hence he can draw close to no one and no
one can ever truly draw close to him. For only the heart creates
intimacy, true closeness between two persons. Only the heart is able to
welcome and offer hospitality. Intimacy is the proper activity and the
domain of the heart. Stavrogin is always infinitely distant, even from
himself, because a man can enter into himself only with the heart, not
with the mind. It is not in a man's power to enter into his own
interiority with the mind. Hence, if the heart is not alive, man remains
a stranger to himself".[^9]

13\. All our actions need to be put under the "political rule" of the
heart. In this way, our aggressiveness and obsessive desires will find
rest in the greater good that the heart proposes and in the power of the
heart to resist evil. The mind and the will are put at the service of
the greater good by sensing and savouring truths, rather than seeking to
master them as the sciences tend to do. The will desires the greater
good that the heart recognizes, while the imagination and emotions are
themselves guided by the beating of the heart.

14\. It could be said, then, that I am my heart, for my heart is what
sets me apart, shapes my spiritual identity and puts me in communion
with other people. The algorithms operating in the digital world show
that our thoughts and will are much more "uniform" than we had
previously thought. They are easily predictable and thus capable of
being manipulated. That is not the case with the heart.

15\. The word "heart" proves its value for philosophy and theology in
their efforts to reach an integral synthesis. Nor can its meaning be
exhausted by biology, psychology, anthropology or any other science. It
is one of those primordial words that "describe realities belonging to
man precisely in so far as he is one whole (as a corporeo-spiritual
person)".[^10] It follows that
biologists are not being more "realistic" when they discuss the heart,
since they see only one aspect of it; the whole is not less real, but
even more real. Nor can abstract language ever acquire the same concrete
and integrative meaning. The word "heart" evokes the inmost core of our
person, and thus it enables us to understand ourselves in our integrity
and not merely under one isolated aspect.

16\. This unique power of the heart also helps us to understand why,
when we grasp a reality with our heart, we know it better and more
fully. This inevitably leads us to the love of which the heart is
capable, for "the inmost core of reality is love".[^11]
 For Heidegger, as interpreted by
one contemporary thinker, philosophy does not begin with a simple
concept or certainty, but with a shock: "Thought must be provoked before
it begins to work with concepts or while it works with them. Without
deep emotion, thought cannot begin. The first mental image would thus be
goose bumps. What first stirs one to think and question is deep emotion.
Philosophy always takes place in a basic mood ( *Stimmung*)".[^12]
 That is where the heart comes in,
since it "houses the states of mind and functions as a 'keeper of the
state of mind'. The 'heart' listens in a non-metaphoric way to 'the
silent voice' of being, allowing itself to be tempered and determined by
it".[^13]

## THE HEART UNITES THE FRAGMENTS

17\. At the same time, the heart makes all authentic bonding possible,
since a relationship not shaped by the heart is incapable of overcoming
the fragmentation caused by individualism. Two monads may approach one
another, but they will never truly connect. A society dominated by
narcissism and self-centredness will increasingly become "heartless".
This will lead in turn to the "loss of desire", since as other persons
disappear from the horizon we find ourselves trapped within walls of our
own making, no longer capable of healthy relationships.[^14]
 As a result, we also become
incapable of openness to God. As Heidegger puts it, to be open to the
divine we need to build a "guest house".[^15]


18\. We see, then, that in the heart of each person there is a
mysterious connection between self-knowledge and openness to others,
between the encounter with one's personal uniqueness and the willingness
to give oneself to others. We become ourselves only to the extent that
we acquire the ability to acknowledge others, while only those who can
acknowledge and accept themselves are then able to encounter others.

19\. The heart is also capable of unifying and harmonizing our personal
history, which may seem hopelessly fragmented, yet is the place where
everything can make sense. The Gospel tells us this in speaking of Our
Lady, who saw things with the heart. She was able to dialogue with the
things she experienced by pondering them in her heart, treasuring their
memory and viewing them in a greater perspective. The best expression of
how the heart thinks is found in the two passages in Saint Luke's Gospel
that speak to us of how Mary "treasured (*synetérei*) all these things
and pondered (*symbállousa*) them in her heart" (cf. *Lk* 2:19 and 51).
The Greek verb *symbállein*, "ponder", evokes the image of putting two
things together ("symbols") in one's mind and reflecting on them, in a
dialogue with oneself. In Luke 2:51, the verb used is *dietérei*, which
has the sense of "keep". What Mary "kept" was not only her memory of
what she had seen and heard, but also those aspects of it that she did
not yet understand; these nonetheless remained present and alive in her
memory, waiting to be "put together" in her heart.

20\. In this age of artificial intelligence, we cannot forget that
poetry and love are necessary to save our humanity. No algorithm will
ever be able to capture, for example, the nostalgia that all of us feel,
whatever our age, and wherever we live, when we recall how we first used
a fork to seal the edges of the pies that we helped our mothers or
grandmothers to make at home. It was a moment of culinary
apprenticeship, somewhere between child-play and adulthood, when we
first felt responsible for working and helping one another. Along with
the fork, I could also mention thousands of other little things that are
a precious part of everyone's life: a smile we elicited by telling a
joke, a picture we sketched in the light of a window, the first game of
soccer we played with a rag ball, the worms we collected in a shoebox, a
flower we pressed in the pages of a book, our concern for a fledgling
bird fallen from its nest, a wish we made in plucking a daisy. All these
little things, ordinary in themselves yet extraordinary for us, can
never be captured by algorithms. The fork, the joke, the window, the
ball, the shoebox, the book, the bird, the flower: all of these live on
as precious memories "kept" deep in our heart.

21\. This profound core, present in every man and woman, is not that of
the soul, but of the entire person in his or her unique psychosomatic
identity. Everything finds its unity in the heart, which can be the
dwelling-place of love in all its spiritual, psychic and even physical
dimensions. In a word, if love reigns in our heart, we become, in a
complete and luminous way, the persons we are meant to be, for every
human being is created above all else for love. In the deepest fibre of
our being, we were made to love and to be loved.

22\. For this reason, when we witness the outbreak of new wars, with the
complicity, tolerance or indifference of other countries, or petty power
struggles over partisan interests, we may be tempted to conclude that
our world is losing its heart. We need only to see and listen to the
elderly women -- from both sides -- who are at the mercy of these
devastating conflicts. It is heart-breaking to see them mourning for
their murdered grandchildren, or longing to die themselves after losing
the homes where they spent their entire lives. Those women, who were
often pillars of strength and resilience amid life's difficulties and
hardships, now, at the end of their days, are experiencing, in place of
a well-earned rest, only anguish, fear and outrage. Casting the blame on
others does not resolve these shameful and tragic situations. To see
these elderly women weep, and not feel that this is something
intolerable, is a sign of a world that has grown heartless.

23\. Whenever a person thinks, questions and reflects on his or her true
identity, strives to understand the deeper questions of life and to seek
God, or experiences the thrill of catching a glimpse of truth, it leads
to the realization that our fulfilment as human beings is found in love.
In loving, we sense that we come to know the purpose and goal of our
existence in this world. Everything comes together in a state of
coherence and harmony. It follows that, in contemplating the meaning of
our lives, perhaps the most decisive question we can ask is, "Do I have
a heart?"

## FIRE

24\. All that we have said has implications for the spiritual life. For
example, the theology underlying the Spiritual Exercises of Saint
Ignatius Loyola is based on "affection" ( *affectus*). The structure of
the Exercises assumes a firm and heartfelt desire to "rearrange" one's
life, a desire that in turn provides the strength and the wherewithal to
achieve that goal. The rules and the compositions of place that Ignatius
furnishes are in the service of something much more important, namely,
the mystery of the human heart. Michel de Certeau shows how the
"movements" of which Ignatius speaks are the "inbreaking" of God's
desire and the desire of our own heart amid the orderly progression of
the meditations. Something unexpected and hitherto unknown starts to
speak in our heart, breaking through our superficial knowledge and
calling it into question. This is the start of a new process of "setting
our life in order", beginning with the heart. It is not about
intellectual concepts that need to be put into practice in our daily
lives, as if affectivity and practice were merely the effects of -- and
dependent upon -- the data of knowledge.[^16]


25\. Where the thinking of the philosopher halts, there the heart of the
believer presses on in love and adoration, in pleading for forgiveness
and in willingness to serve in whatever place the Lord allows us to
choose, in order to follow in his footsteps. At that point, we realize
that in God's eyes we are a "Thou", and for that very reason we can be
an "I". Indeed, only the Lord offers to treat each one of us as a
"Thou", always and forever. Accepting his friendship is a matter of the
heart; it is what constitutes us as persons in the fullest sense of that
word.

26\. Saint Bonaventure tells us that in the end we should not pray for
light, but for "raging fire".[^17]
 He teaches that, "faith is in the intellect, in such a way as
to provoke affection. In this sense, for example, the knowledge that
Christ died for us does not remain knowledge, but necessarily becomes
affection, love".[^18]  Along
the same lines, Saint John Henry Newman took as his motto the phrase
*Cor ad cor loquitur*, since, beyond all our thoughts and ideas, the
Lord saves us by speaking to our hearts from his Sacred Heart. This
realization led him, the distinguished intellectual, to recognize that
his deepest encounter with himself and with the Lord came not from his
reading or reflection, but from his prayerful dialogue, heart to heart,
with Christ, alive and present. It was in the Eucharist that Newman
encountered the living heart of Jesus, capable of setting us free,
giving meaning to each moment of our lives, and bestowing true peace: "O
most Sacred, most loving Heart of Jesus, Thou art concealed in the Holy
Eucharist, and Thou beatest for us still... I worship Thee then with all
my best love and awe, with my fervent affection, with my most subdued,
most resolved will. O my God, when Thou dost condescend to suffer me to
receive Thee, to eat and drink Thee, and Thou for a while takest up Thy
abode within me, O make my heart beat with Thy Heart. Purify it of all
that is earthly, all that is proud and sensual, all that is hard and
cruel, of all perversity, of all disorder, of all deadness. So fill it
with Thee, that neither the events of the day nor the circumstances of
the time may have power to ruffle it, but that in Thy love and Thy fear
it may have peace".[^19]

27\. Before the heart of Jesus, living and present, our mind,
enlightened by the Spirit, grows in the understanding of his words and
our will is moved to put them into practice. This could easily remain on
the level of a kind of self-reliant moralism. Hearing and tasting the
Lord, and paying him due honour, however, is a matter of the heart. Only
the heart is capable of setting our other powers and passions, and our
entire person, in a stance of reverence and loving obedience before the
Lord.

## THE WORLD CAN CHANGE, BEGINNING WITH THE HEART

28\. It is only by starting from the heart that our communities will
succeed in uniting and reconciling differing minds and wills, so that
the Spirit can guide us in unity as brothers and sisters. Reconciliation
and peace are also born of the heart. The heart of Christ is "ecstasy",
openness, gift and encounter. In that heart, we learn to relate to one
another in wholesome and happy ways, and to build up in this world God's
kingdom of love and justice. Our hearts, united with the heart of
Christ, are capable of working this social miracle.

29\. Taking the heart seriously, then, has consequences for society as a
whole. [The Second Vatican
Council](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index_it.htm)
teaches that, "every one of us needs a change of heart; we must set our
gaze on the whole world and look to those tasks we can all perform
together in order to bring about the betterment of our race".[^20]
 For "the imbalances affecting the
world today are in fact a symptom of a deeper imbalance rooted in the
human heart".[^21] In pondering the
tragedies afflicting our world, the Council urges us to return to the
heart. It explains that human beings "by their interior life, transcend
the entire material universe; they experience this deep interiority when
they enter into their own heart, where God, who probes the heart, awaits
them, and where they decide their own destiny in the sight of God".[^22]


30\. This in no way implies an undue reliance on our own abilities. Let
us never forget that our hearts are not self-sufficient, but frail and
wounded. They possess an ontological dignity, yet at the same time must
seek an ever more dignified life.[^23]
The Second Vatican Council points out that "the ferment of the Gospel
has aroused and continues to arouse in human hearts an unquenchable
thirst for human dignity".[^24] Yet to
live in accordance with this dignity, it is not enough to know the
Gospel or to carry out mechanically its demands. We need the help of
God's love. Let us turn, then, to the heart of Christ, that core of his
being, which is a blazing furnace of divine and human love and the most
sublime fulfilment to which humanity can aspire. There, in that heart,
we truly come at last to know ourselves and we learn how to love.

31\. In the end, that Sacred Heart is the unifying principle of all
reality, since "Christ is the heart of the world, and the paschal
mystery of his death and resurrection is the centre of history, which,
because of him, is a history of salvation".[^25]
 All creatures "are moving forward with us and through us
towards a common point of arrival, which is God, in that transcendent
fullness where the risen Christ embraces and illumines all things".[^26]
 In the presence of the heart of
Christ, I once more ask the Lord to have mercy on this suffering world
in which he chose to dwell as one of us. May he pour out the treasures
of his light and love, so that our world, which presses forward despite
wars, socio-economic disparities and uses of technology that threaten
our humanity, may regain the most important and necessary thing of all:
its heart.

# CHAPTER TWO

## ACTIONS AND WORDS OF LOVE

32\. The heart of Christ, as the symbol of the deepest and most personal
source of his love for us, is the very core of the initial preaching of
the Gospel. It stands at the origin of our faith, as the wellspring that
refreshes and enlivens our Christian beliefs.

## ACTIONS THAT REFLECT THE HEART

33\. Christ showed the depth of his love for us not by lengthy
explanations but by concrete actions. By examining his interactions with
others, we can come to realize how he treats each one of us, even though
at times this may be difficult to see. Let us now turn to the place
where our faith can encounter this truth: the word of God.

34\. The Gospel tells us that Jesus "came to his own" (cf. *Jn* 1:11).
Those words refer to us, for the Lord does not treat us as strangers but
as a possession that he watches over and cherishes. He treats us truly
as "his own". This does not mean that we are his slaves, something that
he himself denies: "I do not call you servants" (*Jn* 15:15). Rather, it
refers to the sense of mutual belonging typical of friends. Jesus came
to meet us, bridging all distances; he became as close to us as the
simplest, everyday realities of our lives. Indeed, he has another name,
"Emmanuel", which means "God with us", God as part of our lives, God as
living in our midst. The Son of God became incarnate and "emptied
himself, taking the form of a slave" (*Phil* 2:7).

35\. This becomes clear when we see Jesus at work. He seeks people out,
approaches them, ever open to an encounter with them. We see it when he
stops to converse with the Samaritan woman at the well where she went to
draw water (cf. *Jn* 4:5-7). We see it when, in the darkness of night,
he meets Nicodemus, who feared to be seen in his presence (cf. *Jn*
3:1-2). We marvel when he allows his feet to be washed by a prostitute
(cf. *Lk* 7:36-50), when he says to the woman caught in adultery,
"Neither do I condemn you" (*Jn* 8:11), or again when he chides the
disciples for their indifference and quietly asks the blind man on the
roadside, "What do you want me to do for you?" (*Mk* 10:51). Christ
shows that God is closeness, compassion and tender love.

36\. Whenever Jesus healed someone, he preferred to do it, not from a
distance but in close proximity: "He stretched out his hand and touched
him" ( *Mt* 8:3). "He touched her hand" ( *Mt* 8:15). "He touched their
eyes" ( *Mt* 9:29). Once he even stopped to cure a deaf man with his own
saliva (cf. *Mk* 7:33), as a mother would do, so that people would not
think of him as removed from their lives. "The Lord knows the fine
science of the caress. In his compassion, God does not love us with
words; he comes forth to meet us and, by his closeness, he shows us the
depth of his tender love".[^27]

37\. If we find it hard to trust others because we have been hurt by
lies, injuries and disappointments, the Lord whispers in our ear: "Take
heart, son!" (*Mt* 9:2), "Take heart, daughter!" (*Mt* 9:22). He
encourages us to overcome our fear and to realize that, with him at our
side, we have nothing to lose. To Peter, in his fright, "Jesus
immediately reached out his hand and caught him", saying, "You of little
faith, why did you doubt?" (*Mt* 14:31). Nor should you be afraid. Let
him draw near and sit at your side. There may be many people we
distrust, but not him. Do not hesitate because of your sins. Keep in
mind that many sinners "came and sat with him" (*Mt* 9:10), yet Jesus
was scandalized by none of them. It was the religious élite that
complained and treated him as "a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax
collectors and sinners" (*Mt* 11:19). When the Pharisees criticized him
for his closeness to people deemed base or sinful, Jesus replied, "I
desire mercy, not sacrifice" (*Mt* 9:13).

38\. That same Jesus is now waiting for you to give him the chance to
bring light to your life, to raise you up and to fill you with his
strength. Before his death, he assured his disciples, "I will not leave
you orphaned; I am coming to you. In a little while the world will no
longer see me, but you will see me" (*Jn* 14:18-19). Jesus always finds
a way to be present in your life, so that you can encounter him.

## JESUS' GAZE

39\. The Gospel tells us that a rich man came up to Jesus, full of
idealism yet lacking in the strength needed to change his life. Jesus
then "looked at him" (*Mk* 10:21). Can you imagine that moment, that
encounter between his eyes and those of Jesus? If Jesus calls you and
summons you for a mission, he first looks at you, plumbs the depths of
your heart and, knowing everything about you, fixes his gaze upon you.
So it was when, "as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two
brothers\... and as he went from there, he saw two other brothers" (*Mt*
4:18, 21).

40\. Many a page of the Gospel illustrates how attentive Jesus was to
individuals and above all to their problems and needs. We are told that,
"when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were
harassed and helpless" (*Mt* 9:36). Whenever we feel that everyone
ignores us, that no one cares what becomes of us, that we are of no
importance to anyone, he remains concerned for us. To Nathanael,
standing apart and busy about his own affairs, he could say, "I saw you
under the fig tree before Philip called you" (*Jn* 1:48).

41\. Precisely out of concern for us, Jesus knows every one of our good
intentions and small acts of charity. The Gospel tells us that once he
"saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins" in the Temple treasury
(*Lk* 21:2) and immediately brought it to the attention of his
disciples. Jesus thus appreciates the good that he sees in us. When the
centurion approached him with complete confidence, "Jesus listened to
him and was amazed" (*Mt* 8:10). How reassuring it is to know that, even
if others are not aware of our good intentions or actions, Jesus sees
them and regards them highly.

42\. In his humanity, Jesus learned this from Mary, his mother. Our Lady
carefully pondered the things she had experienced; she "treasured
them... in her heart" (*Lk* 2:19, 51) and, with Saint Joseph, she taught
Jesus from his earliest years to be attentive in this same way.

## JESUS' WORDS

43\. Although the Scriptures preserve Jesus' words, ever alive and
timely, there are moments when he speaks to us inwardly, calls us and
leads us to a better place. That better place is his heart. There he
invites us to find fresh strength and peace: "Come to me, all who are
weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest" (*Mt*
11:28). In this sense, he could say to his disciples, "Abide in me"
(*Jn* 15:4).

44\. Jesus' words show that his holiness did not exclude deep emotions.
On various occasions, he demonstrated a love that was both passionate
and compassionate. He could be deeply moved and grieved, even to the
point of shedding tears. It is clear that Jesus was not indifferent to
the daily cares and concerns of people, such as their weariness or
hunger: "I have compassion for this crowd\... they have nothing to
eat\... they will faint on the way, and some of them have come from a
great distance" (*Mk* 8:2-3).

45\. The Gospel makes no secret of Jesus' love for Jerusalem: "As he
came near and saw the city, he wept over it" (*Lk* 19:41). He then
voiced the deepest desire of his heart: "If you had only recognized on
this day the things that make for peace" (*Lk* 19:42). The evangelists,
while at times showing him in his power and glory, also portray his
profound emotions in the face of death and the grief felt by his
friends. Before recounting how Jesus, standing before the tomb of
Lazarus, "began to weep" (*Jn* 11:35), the Gospel observes that, "Jesus
loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus" (*Jn* 11:5) and that, seeing
Mary and those who were with her weeping, "he was greatly disturbed in
spirit and deeply moved" (*Jn* 11:33). The Gospel account leaves no
doubt that his tears were genuine, the sign of inner turmoil. Nor do the
Gospels attempt to conceal Jesus' anguish over his impending violent
death at the hands of those whom he had loved so greatly: he "began to
be distressed and agitated" (*Mk* 14:33), even to the point of crying
out, "I am deeply grieved, even to death" (*Mk* 14:34). This inner
turmoil finds its most powerful expression in his cry from the cross:
"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (*Mk* 15:34).

46\. At first glance, all this may smack of pious sentimentalism. Yet it
is supremely serious and of decisive importance, and finds its most
sublime expression in Christ crucified. The cross is Jesus' most
eloquent word of love. A word that is not shallow, sentimental or merely
edifying. It is love, sheer love. That is why Saint Paul, struggling to
find the right words to describe his relationship with Christ, could
speak of "the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me" (*Gal*
2:20). This was Paul's deepest conviction: the knowledge that he was
loved. Christ's self-offering on the cross became the driving force in
Paul's life, yet it only made sense to him because he knew that
something even greater lay behind it: the fact that "he loved me". At a
time when many were seeking salvation, prosperity or security elsewhere,
Paul, moved by the Spirit, was able to see farther and to marvel at the
greatest and most essential thing of all: "Christ loved me".

47\. Now, after considering Christ and seeing how his actions and words
grant us insight into his heart, let us turn to the Church's reflection
on the holy mystery of the Lord's Sacred Heart.

# CHAPTER THREE

## THIS IS THE HEART THAT HAS LOVED SO GREATLY

48\. Devotion to the heart of Christ is not the veneration of a single
organ apart from the Person of Jesus. What we contemplate and adore is
the whole Jesus Christ, the Son of God made man, represented by an image
that accentuates his heart. That heart of flesh is seen as the
privileged sign of the inmost being of the incarnate Son and his love,
both divine and human. More than any other part of his body, the heart
of Jesus is "the natural sign and symbol of his boundless love".[^28]
 

## WORSHIPING CHRIST

49\. It is essential to realize that our relationship to the Person of
Jesus Christ is one of friendship and adoration, drawn by the love
represented under the image of his heart. We venerate that image, yet
our worship is directed solely to the living Christ, in his divinity and
his plenary humanity, so that we may be embraced by his human and divine
love.

50\. Whatever the image employed, it is clear that the living heart of
Christ -- not its representation -- is the object of our worship, for it
is part of his holy risen body, which is inseparable from the Son of God
who assumed that body forever. We worship it because it is "the heart of
the Person of the Word, to whom it is inseparably united".[^29]
  Nor do we worship it
for its own sake, but because with this heart the incarnate Son is
alive, loves us and receives our love in return. Any act of love or
worship of his heart is thus "really and truly given to Christ himself",[^30]
  since it spontaneously
refers back to him and is "a symbol and a tender image of the infinite
love of Jesus Christ".[^31] 

51\. For this reason, it should never be imagined that this devotion may
distract or separate us from Jesus and his love. In a natural and direct
way, it points us to him and to him alone, who calls us to a precious
friendship marked by dialogue, affection, trust and adoration. The
Christ we see depicted with a pierced and burning heart is the same
Christ who, for love of us, was born in Bethlehem, passed through
Galilee healing the sick, embracing sinners and showing mercy. The same
Christ who loved us to the very end, opening wide his arms on the cross,
who then rose from the dead and now lives among us in glory.

## VENERATING HIS IMAGE

52\. While the image of Christ and his heart is not in itself an object
of worship, neither is it simply one among many other possible images.
It was not devised at a desk or designed by an artist; it is "no
imaginary symbol, but a real symbol which represents the centre, the
source from which salvation flowed for all humanity".[^32]
 

53\. Universal human experience has made the image of the heart
something unique. Indeed, throughout history and in different parts of
the world, it has become a symbol of personal intimacy, affection,
emotional attachment and capacity for love. Transcending all scientific
explanations, a hand placed on the heart of a friend expresses special
affection: when two persons fall in love and draw close to one another,
their hearts beat faster; when we are abandoned or deceived by someone
we love, our hearts sink. So too, when we want to say something deeply
personal, we often say that we are speaking "from the heart". The
language of poetry reflects the power of these experiences. In the
course of history, the heart has taken on unique symbolic value that is
more than merely conventional.

54\. It is understandable, then, that the Church has chosen the image of
the heart to represent the human and divine love of Jesus Christ and the
inmost core of his Person. Yet, while the depiction of a heart afire may
be an eloquent symbol of the burning love of Jesus Christ, it is
important that this heart not be represented apart from him. In this
way, his summons to a personal relationship of encounter and dialogue
will become all the more meaningful.[^33]
  The venerable image portraying Christ holding out
his loving heart also shows him looking directly at us, inviting us to
encounter, dialogue and trust; it shows his strong hands capable of
supporting us and his lips that speak personally to each of us.

55\. The heart, too, has the advantage of being immediately recognizable
as the profound unifying centre of the body, an expression of the
totality of the person, unlike other individual organs. As a part that
stands for the whole, we could easily misinterpret it, were we to
contemplate it apart from the Lord himself. The image of the heart
should lead us to contemplate Christ in all the beauty and richness of
his humanity and divinity.

56\. Whatever particular aesthetic qualities we may ascribe to various
portrayals of Christ's heart when we pray before them, it is not the
case that "something is sought from them or that blind trust is put in
images as once was done by the Gentiles". Rather, "through these images
that we kiss, and before which we kneel and uncover our heads, we are
adoring Christ".[^34] 

57\. Certain of these representations may indeed strike us as tasteless
and not particularly conducive to affection or prayer. Yet this is of
little importance, since they are only invitations to prayer, and, to
cite an Eastern proverb, we should not limit our gaze to the finger that
points us to the moon. Whereas the Eucharist is a real presence to be
worshiped, sacred images, albeit blessed, point beyond themselves,
inviting us to lift up our hearts and to unite them to the heart of the
living Christ. The image we venerate thus serves as a summons to make
room for an encounter with Christ, and to worship him in whatever way we
wish to picture him. Standing before the image, we stand before Christ,
and in his presence, "love pauses, contemplates mystery, and enjoys it
in silence".[^35] 

58\. At the same time, we must never forget that the image of the heart
speaks to us of the flesh and of earthly realities. In this way, it
points us to the God who wished to become one of us, a part of our
history, and a companion on our earthly journey. A more abstract or
stylized form of devotion would not necessarily be more faithful to the
Gospel, for in this eloquent and tangible sign we see how God willed to
reveal himself and to draw close to us.

## A LOVE THAT IS TANGIBLE

59\. On the other hand, love and the human heart do not always go
together, since hatred, indifference and selfishness can also reign in
our hearts. Yet we cannot attain our fulfilment as human beings unless
we open our hearts to others; only through love do we become fully
ourselves. The deepest part of us, created for love, will fulfil God's
plan only if we learn to love. And the heart is the symbol of that love.

60\. The eternal Son of God, in his utter transcendence, chose to love
each of us with a human heart. His human emotions became the sacrament
of that infinite and endless love. His heart, then, is not merely a
symbol for some disembodied spiritual truth. In gazing upon the Lord's
heart, we contemplate a physical reality, his human flesh, which enables
him to possess genuine human emotions and feelings, like ourselves,
albeit fully transformed by his divine love. Our devotion must ascend to
the infinite love of the Person of the Son of God, yet we need to keep
in mind that his divine love is inseparable from his human love. The
image of his heart of flesh helps us to do precisely this.

61\. Since the heart continues to be seen in the popular mind as the
affective centre of each human being, it remains the best means of
signifying the divine love of Christ, united forever and inseparably to
his wholly human love. Pius XII observed that the Gospel, in referring
to the love of Christ's heart, speaks "not only of divine charity but
also human affection". Indeed, "the heart of Jesus Christ,
hypostatically united to the divine Person of the Word, beyond doubt
throbbed with love and every other tender affection".[^36]
 

62\. The Fathers of the Church, opposing those who denied or downplayed
the true humanity of Christ, insisted on the concrete and tangible
reality of the Lord's human affections. Saint Basil emphasized that the
Lord's incarnation was not something fanciful, and that "the Lord
possessed our natural affections".[^37]
  Saint John Chrysostom pointed to an example: "Had he
not possessed our nature, he would not have experienced sadness from
time to time".[^38]  Saint
Ambrose stated that "in taking a soul, he took on the passions of the
soul".[^39]  For Saint
Augustine, our human affections, which Christ assumed, are now open to
the life of grace: "The Lord Jesus assumed these affections of our human
weakness, as he did the flesh of our human weakness, not out of
necessity, but consciously and freely\... lest any who feel grief and
sorrow amid the trials of life should think themselves separated from
his grace".[^40]  Finally,
Saint John Damascene viewed the genuine affections shown by Christ in
his humanity as proof that he assumed our nature in its entirety in
order to redeem and transform it in its entirety: Christ, then, assumed
all that is part of human nature, so that all might be sanctified.[^41]
 

63\. Here, we can benefit from the thoughts of a theologian who
maintains that, "due to the influence of Greek thought, theology long
relegated the body and feelings to the world of the pre-human or
sub-human or potentially inhuman; yet what theology did not resolve in
theory, spirituality resolved in practice. This, together with popular
piety, preserved the relationship with the corporal, psychological and
historical reality of Jesus. The Stations of the Cross, devotion to
Christ's wounds, his Precious Blood and his Sacred Heart, and a variety
of Eucharist devotions\... all bridged the gaps in theology by
nourishing our hearts and imagination, our tender love for Christ, our
hope and memory, our desires and feelings. Reason and logic took other
directions".[^42] 

## A THREEFOLD LOVE

64\. Nor do we remain only on the level of the Lord's human feelings,
beautiful and moving as they are. In contemplating Christ's heart we
also see how, in his fine and noble sentiments, his kindness and
gentleness and his signs of genuine human affection, the deeper truth of
his infinite divine love is revealed. In the words of [Benedict
XVI](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html), "from the
infinite horizon of his love, God wished to enter into the limits of
human history and the human condition. He took on a body and a heart.
Thus, we can contemplate and encounter the infinite in the finite, the
invisible and ineffable mystery in the human heart of Jesus the
Nazarene".[^43] 

65\. The image of the Lord's heart speaks to us in fact of a threefold
love. First, we contemplate his infinite divine love. Then our thoughts
turn to the spiritual dimension of his humanity, in which the heart is
"the symbol of that most ardent love which, infused into his soul,
enriches his human will". Finally, "it is a symbol also of his sensible
love".[^44] 

66\. These three loves are not separate, parallel or disconnected, but
together act and find expression in a constant and vital unity. For "by
faith, through which we believe that the human and divine nature were
united in the Person of Christ, we can see the closest bonds between the
tender love of the physical heart of Jesus and the twofold spiritual
love, namely human and divine".[^45]


67\. Entering into the heart of Christ, we feel loved by a human heart
filled with affections and emotions like our own. Jesus' human will
freely choose to love us, and that spiritual love is flooded with grace
and charity. When we plunge into the depths of his heart, we find
ourselves overwhelmed by the immense glory of his infinite love as the
eternal Son, which we can no longer separate from his human love. It is
precisely in his human love, and not apart from it, that we encounter
his divine love: we discover "the infinite in the finite".[^46]
 

68\. It is the constant and unequivocal teaching of the Church that our
worship of Christ's person is undivided, inseparably embracing both his
divine and his human natures. From ancient times, the Church has taught
that we are to "adore one and the same Christ, the Son of God and of
man, consisting of and in two inseparable and undivided natures".[^47]
  And we do so "with one
act of adoration... inasmuch as the Word became flesh".[^48]
  Christ is in no way
"worshipped in two natures, whereby two acts of worship are introduced";
instead, we venerate "by one act of worship God the Word made flesh,
together with his own flesh".[^49]


69\. Saint John of the Cross sought to explain that in mystical
experience the infinite love of the risen Christ is not perceived as
alien to our lives. The infinite in some way "condescends" to enable us,
through the open heart of Christ, to experience an encounter of truly
reciprocal love, for "it is indeed credible that a bird of lowly flight
can capture the royal eagle of the heights, if this eagle descends with
the desire of being captured".[^50]
 He also explains that the Bridegroom, "beholding that the
bride is wounded with love for him, because of her moan he too is
wounded with love for her. Among lovers, the wound of one is the wound
of both".[^51]  John of the
Cross regards the image of Christ's pierced side as an invitation to
full union with the Lord. Christ is the wounded stag, wounded when we
fail to let ourselves be touched by his love, who descends to the
streams of water to quench his thirst and is comforted whenever we turn
to him:

> 
> "*Return, dove!
> 
> The wounded stag*
> 
> is in sight on the hill,
> 
> cooled by the breeze of your flight*".[^52] 
>

## TRINITARIAN PERSPECTIVES

70\. Devotion to the heart of Jesus, as a direct contemplation of the
Lord that draws us into union with him, is clearly Christological in
nature. We see this in the Letter to the Hebrews, which urges us to "run
with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus"
(12:2). At the same time, we need to realize that Jesus speaks of
himself as the way to the Father: "I am the way... No one comes to the
Father except through me" ( *Jn* 14:6). Jesus wants to bring us to the
Father. That is why, from the very beginning, the Church's preaching
does not end with Jesus, but with the Father. As source and fullness,
the Father is ultimately the one to be glorified.[^53]
 

71\. If we turn, for example, to the Letter to the Ephesians, we can see
clearly how our worship is directed to the Father: "I bow my knees
before the Father" (3:14). There is "one God and Father of all, who is
above all and through all and in all" (4:6). "Give thanks to God the
Father at all times and for everything" (5:20). It is the Father "for
whom we exist" ( *1 Cor* 8:6). In this sense, [Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) could say that,
"the whole of the Christian life is like a great pilgrimage to the house
of the Father".[^54]  This
too was the experience of Saint Ignatius of Antioch on his path to
martyrdom: "In me there is left no spark of desire for mundane things,
but only a murmur of living water that whispers within me, 'Come to the
Father'".[^55] 

72\. The Father is, before all else, the Father of Jesus Christ:
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" *(Eph* 1:3). He
is "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory" ( *Eph*
1:17). When the Son became man, all the hopes and aspirations of his
human heart were directed towards the Father. If we consider the way
Christ spoke of the Father, we can grasp the love and affection that his
human heart felt for him, this complete and constant orientation towards
him.[^56] Jesus' life among us was a
journey of response to the constant call of his human heart to come to
the Father.[^57] 

73\. We know that the Aramaic word Jesus used to address the Father was
"*Abba"*, an intimate and familiar term that some found disconcerting
(cf. *Jn* 5:18). It is how he addressed the Father in expressing his
anguish at his impending death: "*Abba,* Father, for you all things are
possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you
want" (*Mk* 14:36). Jesus knew well that he had always been loved by the
Father: "You loved me before the foundation of the world" (*Jn* 17:24).
In his human heart, he had rejoiced at hearing the Father say to him:
"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased" (*Mk* 1:11).

74\. The Fourth Gospel tells us that the eternal Son was always "close
to the Father's heart" ( *Jn* 1:18).[^58]
  Saint Irenaeus thus declares that "the Son of God
was with the Father from the beginning".[^59]
  Origen, for his part, maintains that the Son
perseveres "in uninterrupted contemplation of the depths of the Father".[^60]
  When the Son took
flesh, he spent entire nights conversing with his beloved Father on the
mountaintop (cf. *Lk* 6:12). He told us, "I must be in my Father's
house" ( *Lk* 2:49). We see too how he expressed his praise: "Jesus
rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, 'I thank you, Father, Lord of
heaven and earth' ( *Lk* 10:21). His last words, full of trust, were,
"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit" ( *Lk* 23:46).

75\. Let us now turn to the Holy Spirit, whose fire fills the heart of
Christ. As [Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) once said,
Christ's heart is "the Holy Spirit's masterpiece".[^61]
  This is more than
simply a past event, for even now "the heart of Christ is alive with the
action of the Holy Spirit, to whom Jesus attributed the inspiration of
his mission (cf. *Lk* 4:18; *Is* 61:1) and whose sending he had promised
at the Last Supper. It is the Spirit who enables us to grasp the
richness of the sign of Christ's pierced side, from which the Church has
sprung (cf. [*Sacrosanctum
Concilium*](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html),
5)".[^62]  In a word, "only
the Holy Spirit can open up before us the fullness of the 'inner man',
which is found in the heart of Christ. He alone can cause our human
hearts to draw strength from that fullness, step by step".[^63]
 

76\. If we seek to delve more deeply into the mysterious working of the
Spirit, we learn that he groans within us, saying "Abba!" Indeed, "the
proof that you are children is that God has sent the Spirit of his Son
into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'" (*Gal* 4:6). For "the Spirit
bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (*Rom* 8:16).
The Holy Spirit at work in Christ's human heart draws him unceasingly to
the Father. When the Spirit unites us to the sentiments of Christ
through grace, he makes us sharers in the Son's relationship to the
Father, whereby we receive "a spirit of adoption through which we cry
out, 'Abba! Father!'" (*Rom* 8:15).

77\. Our relationship with the heart of Christ is thus changed, thanks
to the prompting of the Spirit who guides us to the Father, the source
of life and the ultimate wellspring of grace. Christ does not expect us
simply to remain in him. His love is "the revelation of the Father's
mercy",[^64]  and his desire
is that, impelled by the Spirit welling up from his heart, we should
ascend to the Father "with him and in him". We give glory to the Father
"through" Christ,[^65] 
"with" Christ,[^66]  and "in"
Christ.[^67] [Saint John
Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html)
taught that, "the Saviour's heart invites us to return to the Father's
love, which is the source of every authentic love".[^68]
  This is precisely what
the Holy Spirit, who comes to us through the heart of Christ, seeks to
nurture in our hearts. For this reason, the liturgy, through the
enlivening work of the Spirit, always addresses the Father from the
risen heart of Christ.

## RECENT TEACHINGS OF THE MAGISTERIUM

78\. In numerous ways, Christ's heart has always been present in the
history of Christian spirituality. In the Scriptures and in the early
centuries of the Church's life, it appeared under the image of the
Lord's wounded side, as a fountain of grace and a summons to a deep and
loving encounter. In this same guise, it has reappeared in the writings
of numerous saints, past and present. In recent centuries, this
spirituality has gradually taken on the specific form of devotion to the
Sacred Heart of Jesus.

79\. A number of my Predecessors have spoken in various ways about the
heart of Christ and exhorted us to unite ourselves to it. At the end of
the nineteenth century, [Leo
XIII](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en.html) encouraged us to
consecrate ourselves to the Sacred Heart, thus uniting our call to union
with Christ and our wonder before the magnificence of his infinite love.[^69]
Some thirty years later, 
[Pius XI](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en.html) presented this 
devotion as a "summa" of the experience of Christian faith.[^70]   
[Pius XII](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en.html) went on to 
declare that adoration of the Sacred Heart expresses in an outstanding 
way, as a sublime synthesis, the worship we owe to Jesus Christ.[^71]
 


80\. More recently, [Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) presented the
growth of this devotion in recent centuries as a response to the rise of
rigorist and disembodied forms of spirituality that neglected the
richness of the Lord's mercy. At the same time, he saw it as a timely
summons to resist attempts to create a world that leaves no room for
God. "Devotion to the Sacred Heart, as it developed in Europe two
centuries ago, under the impulse of the mystical experiences of Saint
Margaret Mary Alacoque, was a response to Jansenist rigor, which ended
up disregarding God's infinite mercy\... The men and women of the third
millennium need the heart of Christ in order to know God and to know
themselves; they need it to build the civilization of love".[^72]
 


81\. [Benedict XVI](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html)
asked us to recognize in the heart of Christ an intimate and daily
presence in our lives: "Every person needs a 'centre' for his or her own
life, a source of truth and goodness to draw upon in the events,
situations and struggles of daily existence. All of us, when we pause in
silence, need to feel not only the beating of our own heart, but deeper
still, the beating of a trustworthy presence, perceptible with faith's
senses and yet much more real: the presence of Christ, the heart of the
world".[^73] 



## FURTHER REFLECTIONS AND RELEVANCE FOR OUR TIMES

82\. The expressive and symbolic image of Christ's heart is not the only
means granted us by the Holy Spirit for encountering the love of Christ,
yet it is, as we have seen, an especially privileged one. Even so, it
constantly needs to be enriched, deepened and renewed through
meditation, the reading of the Gospel and growth in spiritual maturity.
[Pius XII](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en.html) made it
clear that the Church does not claim that, "we must contemplate and
adore in the heart of Jesus a 'formal' image, that is, a perfect and
absolute sign of his divine love, for the essence of this love can in no
way be adequately expressed by any created image whatsoever".[^74]
 

83\. Devotion to Christ's heart is essential for our Christian life to
the extent that it expresses our openness in faith and adoration to the
mystery of the Lord's divine and human love. In this sense, we can once
more affirm that the Sacred Heart is a synthesis of the Gospel.[^75]
  We need to remember
that the visions or mystical showings related by certain saints who
passionately encouraged devotion to Christ's heart are not something
that the faithful are obliged to believe as if they were the word of
God.[^76]  Nonetheless, they
are rich sources of encouragement and can prove greatly beneficial, even
if no one need feel forced to follow them should they not prove helpful
on his or her own spiritual journey. At the same time, however, we
should be mindful that, as [Pius
XII](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en.html) pointed out, this
devotion cannot be said "to owe its origin to private revelations".[^77]
 

84\. The promotion of Eucharistic communion on the first Friday of each
month, for example, sent a powerful message at a time when many people
had stopped receiving communion because they were no longer confident of
God's mercy and forgiveness and regarded communion as a kind of reward
for the perfect. In the context of Jansenism, the spread of this
practice proved immensely beneficial, since it led to a clearer
realization that in the Eucharist the merciful and ever-present love of
the heart of Christ invites us to union with him. It can also be said
that this practice can prove similarly beneficial in our own time, for a
different reason. Amid the frenetic pace of today's world and our
obsession with free time, consumption and diversion, cell phones and
social media, we forget to nourish our lives with the strength of the
Eucharist.

85\. While no one should feel obliged to spend an hour in adoration each
Thursday, the practice ought surely to be recommended. When we carry it
out with devotion, in union with many of our brothers and sisters and
discover in the Eucharist the immense love of the heart of Christ, we
"adore, together with the Church, the sign and manifestation of the
divine love that went so far as to love, through the heart of the
incarnate Word, the human race".[^78]


86\. Many Jansenists found this difficult to comprehend, for they looked
askance on all that was human, affective and corporeal, and so viewed
this devotion as distancing us from pure worship of the Most High God.
Pius XII described as "false mysticism"[^79]
  the elitist attitude of those groups that saw God as
so sublime, separate and distant that they regarded affective
expressions of popular piety as dangerous and in need of ecclesiastical
oversight.

87\. It could be argued that today, in place of Jansenism, we find
ourselves before a powerful wave of secularization that seeks to build a
world free of God. In our societies, we are also seeing a proliferation
of varied forms of religiosity that have nothing to do with a personal
relationship with the God of love, but are new manifestations of a
disembodied spirituality. I must warn that within the Church too, a
baneful Jansenist dualism has re-emerged in new forms. This has gained
renewed strength in recent decades, but it is a recrudescence of that
Gnosticism which proved so great a spiritual threat in the early
centuries of Christianity because it refused to acknowledge the reality
of "the salvation of the flesh". For this reason, I turn my gaze to the
heart of Christ and I invite all of us to renew our devotion to it. I
hope this will also appeal to today's sensitivities and thus help us to
confront the dualisms, old and new, to which this devotion offers an
effective response.

88\. I would add that the heart of Christ also frees us from another
kind of dualism found in communities and pastors excessively caught up
in external activities, structural reforms that have little to do with
the Gospel, obsessive reorganization plans, worldly projects, secular
ways of thinking and mandatory programmes. The result is often a
Christianity stripped of the tender consolations of faith, the joy of
serving others, the fervour of personal commitment to mission, the
beauty of knowing Christ and the profound gratitude born of the
friendship he offers and the ultimate meaning he gives to our lives.
This too is the expression of an illusory and disembodied
otherworldliness.

89\. Once we succumb to these attitudes, so widespread in our day, we
tend to lose all desire to be cured of them. This leads me to propose to
the whole Church renewed reflection on the love of Christ represented in
his Sacred Heart. For there we find the whole Gospel, a synthesis of the
truths of our faith, all that we adore and seek in faith, all that
responds to our deepest needs.

90\. As we contemplate the heart of Christ, the incarnate synthesis of
the Gospel, we can, following the example of Saint Therese of the Child
Jesus, "place heartfelt trust not in ourselves but in the infinite mercy
of a God who loves us unconditionally and has already given us
everything in the cross of Jesus Christ".[^80]
  Therese was able to do this because she had
discovered in the heart of Christ that God is love: "To me he has
granted his infinite mercy, and through it I contemplate and adore the
other divine perfections".[^81]
 That is why a popular prayer, directed like an arrow towards
the heart of Christ, says simply: "Jesus, I trust in you".[^82]
 No other words are needed.

91\. In the following chapters, we will emphasize two essential aspects
that contemporary devotion to the Sacred Heart needs to combine, so that
it can continue to nourish us and bring us closer to the Gospel:
personal spiritual experience and communal missionary commitment.

# CHAPTER FOUR

## A LOVE THAT GIVES ITSELF AS DRINK

92\. Let us now return to the Scriptures, the inspired texts where,
above all, we encounter God's revelation. There, and in the Church's
living Tradition, we hear what the Lord has wished to tell us in the
course of history. By reading several texts from the Old and the New
Testaments, we will gain insight into the word of God that has guided
the great spiritual pilgrimage of his people down the ages.

## A GOD WHO THIRSTS FOR LOVE

93\. The Bible shows that the people that journeyed through the desert
and yearned for freedom received the promise of an abundance of
life-giving water: "With joy you will draw water from the wells of
salvation" (*Is* 12:3). The messianic prophecies gradually coalesced
around the imagery of purifying water: "I will sprinkle clean water upon
you, and you shall be clean... a new spirit I will put within you"
(*Ezek* 36:25-26). This water would bestow on God's people the fullness
of life, like a fountain flowing from the Temple and bringing a wealth
of life and salvation in its wake. "I saw on the bank of the river a
great many trees on the one side and on the other... and wherever that
river goes, every living creature will live... and when that river
enters the sea, its waters will become fresh; everything will live where
the river goes" (*Ezek* 47:7-9).

94\. The Jewish festival of Booths ( *Sukkot*), which recalls the
forty-year sojourn of Israel in the desert, gradually adopted the
symbolism of water as a central element. It included a rite of offering
water each morning, which became most solemn on the final day of the
festival, when a great procession took place towards the Temple, the
altar was circled seven times and the water was offered to God amid loud
cries of joy.[^83]

95\. The dawn of the messianic era was described as a fountain springing
up for the people: "I will pour out a spirit of compassion and
supplication on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
they shall look on him whom they have pierced... On that day, a fountain
shall be opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
to cleanse them from sin and impurity" (*Zech* 12:10; 13:1).

96\. One who is pierced, a flowing fountain, the outpouring of a spirit
of compassion and supplication: the first Christians inevitably
considered these promises fulfilled in the pierced side of Christ, the
wellspring of new life. In the Gospel of John, we contemplate that
fulfilment. From Jesus' wounded side, the water of the Spirit poured
forth: "One of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once
blood and water flowed out" (*Jn* 19:34). The evangelist then recalls
the prophecy that had spoken of a fountain opened in Jerusalem and the
pierced one (*Jn* 19:37; cf. *Zech* 12:10). The open fountain is the
wounded side of Christ.

97\. Earlier, John's Gospel had spoken of this event, when on "the last
day of the festival" (*Jn* 7:37), Jesus cried out to the people
celebrating the great procession: "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me
and drink... out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water" (*Jn*
7:37-38). For this to be accomplished, however, it was necessary for
Jesus' "hour" to come, for he "was not yet glorified" (*Jn* 7:39). That
fulfilment was to come on the cross, in the blood and water that flowed
from the Lord's side.

98\. The Book of Revelation takes up the prophecies of the pierced one
and the fountain: "every eye will see him, even those who pierced him"
(*Rev* 1:7); "Let everyone who is thirsty come; let anyone who wishes
take the water of life as a gift" (*Rev* 22:17).

99\. The pierced side of Jesus is the source of the love that God had
shown for his people in countless ways. Let us now recall some of his
words:

 "Because you are precious in my sight and honoured, I love you" (*Is*
43:4).

 "Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the
child of her womb? Even if these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands" (*Is* 49:15-16).

 "For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed, but my
steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall
not be removed" (*Is* 54:10).

 "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued
my faithfulness to you" (*Jer* 31:3).

 "The Lord, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives you victory;
he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love;
he will exult over you with loud singing" (*Zeph* 3:17).

100\. The prophet Hosea goes so far as to speak of the heart of God, who
"led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love" (*Hos*
11:4). When that love was spurned, the Lord could say, "My heart is
stirred within me; my compassion grows warm and tender (*Hos* 11:8).
God's merciful love always triumphs (cf. *Hos* 11:9), and it was to find
its most sublime expression in Christ, his definitive Word of love.

101\. The pierced heart of Christ embodies all God's declarations of
love present in the Scriptures. That love is no mere matter of words;
rather, the open side of his Son is a source of life for those whom he
loves, the fount that quenches the thirst of his people. As [Saint John
Paul II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) pointed
out, "the essential elements of devotion \[to the Sacred Heart\] belong
in a permanent fashion to the spirituality of the Church throughout her
history; for since the beginning, the Church has looked to the heart of
Christ pierced on the Cross".[^84]

## ECHOES OF THE WORD IN HISTORY

102\. Let us consider some of the ways that, in the history of the
Christian faith, these prophecies were understood to have been
fulfilled. Various Fathers of the Church, especially those in Asia
Minor, spoke of the wounded side of Jesus as the source of the water of
the Holy Spirit: the word, its grace and the sacraments that communicate
it. The courage of the martyrs is born of "the heavenly fount of living
waters flowing from the side of Christ"[^85]
 or, in the version of Rufinus, "the heavenly and eternal
streams that flow from the heart of Christ".[^86]
 We believers, reborn in the
Spirit, emerge from the cleft in the rock; "we have come forth from the
heart of Christ".[^87] His wounded
side, understood as his heart, filled with the Holy Spirit, comes to us
as a flood of living water. "The fount of the Spirit is entirely in
Christ".[^88] Yet the Spirit whom we
have received does not distance us from the risen Lord, but fills us
with his presence, for by drinking of the Spirit we drink of the same
Christ. In the words of Saint Ambrose: "Drink of Christ, for he is the
rock that pours forth a flood of water. Drink of Christ, for he is the
source of life. Drink of Christ, for he is the river whose streams
gladden the city of God. Drink of Christ, for he is our peace. Drink of
Christ, for from his side flows living water".[^89]


103\. Saint Augustine opened the way to devotion to the Sacred Heart as
the locus of our personal encounter with the Lord. For Augustine,
Christ's wounded side is not only the source of grace and the
sacraments, but also the symbol of our intimate union with Christ, the
setting of an encounter of love. There we find the source of the most
precious wisdom of all, which is knowledge of him. In effect, Augustine
writes that John, the beloved disciple, reclining on Jesus' bosom at the
Last Supper, drew near to the secret place of wisdom.[^90]
 Here we have no merely
intellectual contemplation of an abstract theological truth. As Saint
Jerome explains, a person capable of contemplation "does not delight in
the beauty of that stream of water, but drinks of the living water
flowing from the side of the Lord".[^91]


104\. Saint Bernard takes up the symbolism of the pierced side of the
Lord and understands it explicitly as a revelation and outpouring of all
of the love of his heart. Through that wound, Christ opens his heart to
us and enables us to appropriate the boundless mystery of his love and
mercy: "I take from the bowels of the Lord what is lacking to me, for
his bowels overflow with mercy through the holes through which they
stream. Those who crucified him pierced his hands and feet, they pierced
his side with a lance. And through those holes I can taste wild honey
and oil from the rocks of flint, that is, I can taste and see that the
Lord is good... A lance passed through his soul even to the region of
his heart. No longer is he unable to take pity on my weakness. The
wounds inflicted on his body have disclosed to us the secrets of his
heart; they enable us to contemplate the great mystery of his
compassion".[^92]

105\. This theme reappears especially in William of Saint-Thierry, who
invites us to enter into the heart of Jesus, who feeds us from his own
breast.[^93] This is not surprising if
we recall that for William, "the art of arts is the art of love... Love
is awakened by the Creator of nature, and is a power of the soul that
leads it, as if by its natural gravity, to its proper place and end".[^94]
 That proper place, where love
reigns in fullness, is the heart of Christ: "Lord, where do you lead
those whom you embrace and clasp to your heart? Your heart, Jesus, is
the sweet manna of your divinity that you hold within the golden jar of
your soul (cf. *Heb* 9:4), and that surpasses all knowledge. Happy those
who, having plunged into those depths, have been hidden by you in the
recess of your heart".[^95]

106\. Saint Bonaventure unites these two spiritual currents. He presents
the heart of Christ as the source of the sacraments and of grace, and
urges that our contemplation of that heart become a relationship between
friends, a personal encounter of love.

107\. Bonaventure makes us appreciate first the beauty of the grace and
the sacraments flowing from the fountain of life that is the wounded
side of the Lord. "In order that from the side of Christ sleeping on the
cross, the Church might be formed and the Scripture fulfilled that says:
'They shall look upon him whom they pierced', one of the soldiers struck
him with a lance and opened his side. This was permitted by divine
Providence so that, in the blood and water flowing from that wound, the
price of our salvation might flow from the hidden wellspring of his
heart, enabling the Church's sacraments to confer the life of grace and
thus to be, for those who live in Christ, like a cup filled from the
living fount springing up to life eternal".[^96]


108\. Bonaventure then asks us to take another step, in order that our
access to grace not be seen as a kind of magic or neo-platonic
emanation, but rather as a direct relationship with Christ, a dwelling
in his heart, so that whoever drinks from that source becomes a friend
of Christ, a loving heart. "Rise up, then, O soul who are a friend of
Christ, and be the dove that nests in the cleft in the rock; be the
sparrow that finds a home and constantly watches over it; be the
turtledove that hides the offspring of its chaste love in that most holy
cleft".[^97]

## THE SPREAD OF DEVOTION TO THE HEART OF CHRIST

109\. Gradually, the wounded side of Christ, as the abode of his love
and the wellspring of the life of grace, began to be associated with his
heart, especially in monastic life. We know that in the course of
history, devotion to the heart of Christ was not always expressed in the
same way, and that its modern developments, related to a variety of
spiritual experiences, cannot be directly derived from the mediaeval
forms, much less the biblical forms in which we glimpse the seeds of
that devotion. This notwithstanding, the Church today rejects nothing of
the good that the Holy Spirit has bestowed on us down the centuries, for
she knows that it will always be possible to discern a clearer and
deeper meaning in certain aspects of that devotion, and to gain new
insights over the course of time.

110\. A number of holy women, in recounting their experiences of
encounter with Christ, have spoken of resting in the heart of the Lord
as the source of life and interior peace. This was the case with Saints
Lutgarde and Mechtilde of Hackeborn, Saint Angela of Foligno and Dame
Julian of Norwich, to mention only a few. Saint Gertrude of Helfta, a
Cistercian nun, tells of a time in prayer when she reclined her head on
the heart of Christ and heard its beating. In a dialogue with Saint John
the Evangelist, she asked him why he had not described in his Gospel
what he experienced when he did the same. Gertrude concludes that "the
sweet sound of those heartbeats has been reserved for modern times, so
that, hearing them, our aging and lukewarm world may be renewed in the
love of God".[^98] Might we think that
this is indeed a message for our own times, a summons to realize how our
world has indeed "grown old", and needs to perceive anew the message of
Christ's love? Saint Gertrude and Saint Mechtilde have been considered
among "the most intimate confidants of the Sacred Heart".[^99]


111\. The Carthusians, encouraged above all by Ludolph of Saxony, found
in devotion to the Sacred Heart a means of growth in affection and
closeness to Christ. All who enter through the wound of his heart are
inflamed with love. Saint Catherine of Siena wrote that the Lord's
sufferings are impossible for us to comprehend, but the open heart of
Christ enables us to have a lively personal encounter with his boundless
love. "I wished to reveal to you the secret of my heart, allowing you to
see it open, so that you can understand that I have loved you so much
more than I could have proved to you by the suffering that I once
endured".[^100]

112\. Devotion to the heart of Christ slowly passed beyond the walls of
the monasteries to enrich the spirituality of saintly teachers,
preachers and founders of religious congregations, who then spread it to
the farthest reaches of the earth.[^101]


113\. Particularly significant was the initiative taken by Saint John
Eudes, who, "after preaching with his confrères a fervent mission in
Rennes, convinced the bishop of that diocese to approve the celebration
of the feast of the Adorable Heart of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was
the first time that such a feast was officially authorized in the
Church. Following this, between the years 1670 and 1671, the bishops of
Coutances, Evreux, Bayeux, Lisieux and Rouen authorized the celebration
of the feast for their respective dioceses".[^102]


SAINT FRANCIS DE SALES

114\. In modern times, mention should be made of the important
contribution of Saint Francis de Sales. Francis frequently contemplated
Christ's open heart, which invites us to dwell therein, in a personal
relationship of love that sheds light on the mysteries of his life. In
his writings, the saintly Doctor of the Church opposes a rigorous
morality and a legalistic piety by presenting the heart of Jesus as a
summons to complete trust in the mysterious working of his grace. We see
this expressed in his letter to Saint Jane Francis de Chantal: "I am
certain that we will remain no longer in ourselves... but dwell forever
in the Lord's wounded side, for apart from him not only can we do
nothing, but even if we were able, we would lack the desire to do
anything".[^103]

115\. For Francis de Sales, true devotion had nothing to do with
superstition or perfunctory piety, since it entails a personal
relationship in which each of us feels uniquely and individually known
and loved by Christ. "This most adorable and lovable heart of our
Master, burning with the love which he professes to us, \[is\] a heart
on which all our names are written... Surely it is a source of profound
consolation to know that we are loved so deeply by our Lord, who
constantly carries us in his heart".[^104]
 With the image of our names written on the heart of Christ,
Saint Francis sought to express the extent to which Christ's love for
each of us is not something abstract and generic, but utterly personal,
enabling each believer to feel known and respected for who he or she is.
"How lovely is this heaven, in which the Lord is its sun and his breast
a fountain of love from which the blessed drink to their heart's
content! Each of us can look therein and see our name carved in letters
of love, which true love alone can read and true love has written. Dear
God! And what too, beloved daughter, of our loved ones? Surely they will
be there too; for even if our hearts have no love, they nonetheless
possess a desire for love and the beginnings of love".[^105]


116\. Francis saw this experience of Christ's love as essential to the
spiritual life, indeed one of the great truths of faith: "Yes, my
beloved daughter, he thinks of you and not only, but even the smallest
hair of your head: this is an article of faith and in no way must it be
doubted".[^106] It follows that the
believer becomes capable of complete abandonment in the heart of Christ,
in which he or she finds repose, comfort and strength: "Oh God! What
happiness to be thus embraced and to recline in the bosom of the
Saviour. Remain thus, beloved daughter, and like another little one,
Saint John, while others are tasting different kinds of food at the
table of the Lord, lay your head, your soul and your spirit, in a
gesture of utter trust, on the loving bosom of this dear Lord".[^107]
 "I hope that you are resting
in the cleft of the turtledove and in the pierced side of our beloved
Saviour... How good is this Lord, my beloved daughter! How loving is his
Heart! Let us remain here, in this holy abode".[^108]


117\. At the same time, faithful to his teaching on the sanctification
of ordinary life, Francis proposes that this experience take place in
the midst of the activities, tasks and obligations of our daily
existence. "You asked me how souls that are attracted in prayer to this
holy simplicity, to this perfect abandonment in God, should conduct
themselves in all their actions? I would reply that, not only in prayer,
but also in the conduct of everyday life they should advance always in
the spirit of simplicity, abandoning and completely surrendering their
soul, their actions and their accomplishments to God's will. And to do
so with a love marked by perfect and absolute trust, abandoning
themselves to grace and to the care of the eternal love that divine
Providence feels for them".[^109]

118\. For this reason, when looking for a symbol to convey his vision of
spiritual life, Francis de Sales concluded: "I have thought, dear
Mother, if you agree, that we should take as our emblem a single heart
pierced by two arrows, the whole enclosed in a crown of thorns".[^110]


## A NEW DECLARATION OF LOVE

119\. Under the salutary influence of this Salesian spirituality, the
events of Paray-le-Monial took place at the end of the seventeenth
century. Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque reported a remarkable series of
apparitions of Christ between the end of December 1673 and June of 1675.
Fundamental to these was a declaration of love that stood out in the
first apparition. Jesus said: "My divine Heart is so inflamed with love
for men, and for you in particular, that, no longer able to contain in
itself the flames of its ardent charity, it must pour them out through
you and be manifested to them, in order to enrich them with its precious
treasures which I now reveal to you".[^111]


120\. Saint Margaret Mary's account is powerful and deeply moving: "He
revealed to me the wonders of his love and the inexplicable secrets of
his Sacred Heart which he had hitherto kept hidden from me, until he
opened it to me for the first time, in such a striking and sensible
manner that he left me no room for doubt".[^112]
 In subsequent appearances,
that consoling message was reiterated: "He revealed to me the ineffable
wonders of his pure love and to what extremes it had led him to love
mankind".[^113]

121\. This powerful realization of the love of Jesus Christ bequeathed
to us by Saint Margaret Mary can spur us to greater union with him. We
need not feel obliged to accept or appropriate every detail of her
spiritual experience, in which, as often happens, God's intervention
combines with human elements related to the individual's own desires,
concerns and interior images.[^114]
Such experiences must always be interpreted in the light of the Gospel
and the rich spiritual tradition of the Church, even as we acknowledge
the good they accomplish in many of our brothers and sisters. In this
way, we can recognize the gifts of the Holy Spirit present in those
experiences of faith and love. More important than any individual detail
is the core of the message handed on to us, which can be summed up in
the words heard by Saint Margaret Mary: "This is the heart that so loved
human beings that it has spared nothing, even to emptying and consuming
itself in order to show them its love".[^115]


122\. This apparition, then, invites us to grow in our encounter with
Christ, putting our trust completely in his love, until we attain full
and definitive union with him. "It is necessary that the divine heart of
Jesus in some way replace our own; that he alone live and work in us and
for us; that his will... work absolutely and without any resistance on
our part; and finally that its affections, thoughts and desires take the
place of our own, especially his love, so that he is loved in himself
and for our sakes. And so, this lovable heart being our all in all, we
can say with Saint Paul that we no longer live our own lives, but it is
he who lives within us".[^116]

123\. In the first message that Saint Margaret Mary received, this
invitation was expressed in vivid, fervent and loving terms. "He asked
for my heart, which I asked him to take, which he did and then placed
myself in his own adorable heart, from which he made me see mine like a
little atom consumed in the fiery furnace of his own".[^117]


124\. At another point, we see that the one who gives himself to us is
the risen and glorified Christ, full of life and light. If indeed, at
different times, he spoke of the suffering that he endured for our sake
and of the ingratitude with which it is met, what we see here are not so
much his blood and painful wounds, but rather the light and fire of the
Lord of life. The wounds of the passion have not disappeared, but are
now transfigured. Here we see the paschal mystery in all its splendour:
"Once, when the Blessed Sacrament was exposed, Jesus appeared,
resplendent in glory, with his five wounds that appeared as so many suns
blazing forth from his sacred humanity, but above all from his adorable
breast, which seemed a fiery furnace. Opening his robe, he revealed his
most loving and lovable heart, which was the living source of those
flames. Then it was that I discovered the ineffable wonders of his pure
love, with which he loves men to the utmost, yet receives from them only
ingratitude and indifference".[^118]

## SAINT CLAUDE DE LA COLOMBIÈRE

125\. When Saint Claude de La Colombière learned of the experiences of
Saint Margaret Mary, he immediately undertook her defence and began to
spread word of the apparitions. Saint Claude played a special role in
developing the understanding of devotion to the Sacred Heart and its
meaning in the light of the Gospel.

126\. Some of the language of Saint Margaret Mary, if poorly understood,
might suggest undue trust in our personal sacrifices and offerings.
Saint Claude insists that contemplation of the heart of Jesus, when
authentic, does not provoke self-complacency or a vain confidence in our
own experiences or human efforts, but rather an ineffable abandonment in
Christ that fills our life with peace, security and decision. He
expressed this absolute confidence most eloquently in a celebrated
prayer:

"My God, I am so convinced that you keep watch over those who hope in
you, and that we can want for nothing when we look for all in you, that
I am resolved in the future to live free from every care and to turn all
my anxieties over to you\... I shall never lose my hope. I shall keep it
to the last moment of my life; and at that moment all the demons in hell
will strive to tear it from me... Others may look for happiness from
their wealth or their talents; others may rest on the innocence of their
life, or the severity of their penance, or the amount of their alms, or
the fervour of their prayers. As for me, Lord, all my confidence is
confidence itself. This confidence has never deceived anyone... I am
sure, therefore, that I shall be eternally happy, since I firmly hope to
be, and because it is from you, O God, that I hope for it".[^119]


127\. In a note of January 1677, after mentioning the assurance he felt
regarding his mission, Claude continued: "I have come to know that God
wanted me to serve him by obtaining the fulfilment of his desires
regarding the devotion that he suggested to a person to whom he
communicates in confidence, and for whose sake he has desired to make
use of my weakness. I have already used it to help several persons".[^120]


128\. It should be recognized that the spirituality of Blessed Claude de
La Colombière resulted in a fine synthesis of the profound and moving
spiritual experience of Saint Margaret Mary and the vivid and concrete
form of contemplation found in the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius
Loyola. At the beginning of the third week of the Exercises, Claude
reflected: "Two things have moved me in a striking way. First, the
attitude of Christ towards those who sought to arrest him. His heart is
full of bitter sorrow; every violent passion is unleashed against him
and all nature is in turmoil, yet amid all this confusion, all these
temptations, his heart remains firmly directed to God. He does not
hesitate to take the part that virtue and the highest virtue suggested
to him. Second, the attitude of that same heart towards Judas who
betrayed him, the apostles who cravenly abandoned him, the priests and
the others responsible for the persecution he suffered; none of these
things was able to arouse in him the slightest sentiment of hatred or
indignation. I present myself anew to this heart free of anger, free of
bitterness, filled instead with genuine compassion towards its enemies".[^121]


## SAINT CHARLES DE FOUCAULD AND SAINT THERESE OF THE CHILD JESUS

129\. Saint Charles de Foucauld and Saint Therese of the Child Jesus,
without intending to, reshaped certain aspects of devotion to the heart
of Christ and thus helped us understand it in an even more evangelical
spirit. Let us now examine how this devotion found expression in their
lives. In the following chapter, we will return to them, in order to
illustrate the distinctively missionary dimension that each of them
brought to the devotion.

### *Iesus Caritas*

130\. In Louye, Charles de Foucauld was accustomed to visit the Blessed
Sacrament with his cousin, Marie de Bondy. One day she showed him an
image of the Sacred Heart.[^122] His
cousin played a fundamental role in Charles's conversion, as he himself
acknowledged: "Since God has made you the first instrument of his
mercies towards me, from you everything else began. Had you not
converted me, brought me to Jesus and taught me little by little, letter
by letter, all that is holy and good, where would I be today?"[^123]
 What Marie awakened in him was
an intense awareness of the love of Jesus. That was the essential thing,
and centred on devotion to the heart of Jesus, in which he encountered
unbounded mercy: "Let us trust in the infinite mercy of the one whose
heart you led me to know".[^124]

131.Later, his spiritual director, Father Henri Huvelin, helped Charles
to deepen his understanding of the inestimable mystery of "this blessed
heart of which you spoke to me so often".[^125]
 On 6 June 1889, Charles
consecrated himself to the Sacred Heart, in which he found a love
without limits. He told Christ, "You have bestowed on me so many
benefits, that it would appear ingratitude towards your heart not to
believe that it is disposed to bestow on me every good, however great,
and that your love and your generosity are boundless".[^126]
 He was to become a hermit
"under the name of the heart of Jesus".[^127]


132\. On 17 May 1906, the same day in which Brother Charles, alone,
could no longer celebrate Mass, he wrote of his promise "to let the
heart of Jesus live in me, so that it is no longer I who live, but the
heart of Jesus that lives in me, as he lived in Nazareth".[^128]
 His friendship with Jesus,
heart to heart, was anything but a privatized piety. It inspired the
austere life he led in Nazareth, born of a desire to imitate Christ and
to be conformed to him. His loving devotion to the heart of Jesus had a
concrete effect on his style of life, and his Nazareth was nourished by
his personal relationship with the heart of Christ.

### *Saint Therese of the Child Jesus*

133\. Like Saint Charles de Foucauld, Saint Therese of the Child Jesus
was influenced by the great renewal of devotion that swept
nineteenth-century France. Father Almire Pichon, the spiritual director
of her family, was seen as a devoted apostle of the Sacred Heart. One of
her sisters took as her name in religion "Sister Marie of the Sacred
Heart", and the monastery that Therese entered was dedicated to the
Sacred Heart. Her devotion nonetheless took on certain distinctive
traits with regard to the customary piety of that age.

134\. When Therese was fifteen, she could speak of Jesus as the one
"whose heart beats in unison with my own".[^129]
 Two years later, speaking of
the image of Christ's heart crowned with thorns, she wrote in a letter:
"You know that I myself do not see the Sacred Heart as everyone else. I
think that the Heart of my Spouse is mine alone, just as mine is his
alone, and I speak to him then in the solitude of this delightful heart
to heart, while waiting to contemplate him one day face to face".[^130]


135.In one of her poems, Therese voiced the meaning of her devotion,
which had to do more with friendship and assurance than with trust in
her sacrifices:

>
> "I need a heart burning with tenderness,
> 
> Who will be my support forever,
> 
> Who loves everything in me, even my weakness...
> 
> And who never leaves me day or night...
> 
> I must have a God who takes on my nature,
>

136\. Perhaps the most important text for understanding the devotion of
Therese to the heart of Christ is a letter that she wrote three months
before her death to her friend Maurice Bellière. "When I see Mary
Magdalene walking up before the many guests, washing with her tears the
feet of her adored Master, whom she is touching for the first time, I
feel that her heart has understood the abysses of love and mercy of the
heart of Jesus, and, sinner though she is, this heart of love was
disposed not only to pardon her but to lavish on her the blessings of
his divine intimacy, to lift her to the highest summits of
contemplation. Ah! dear little Brother, ever since I have been given the
grace to understand also the love of the heart of Jesus, I admit that it
has expelled all fear from my heart. The remembrance of my faults
humbles me, draws me never to depend on my strength which is only
weakness, but this remembrance speaks to me of mercy and love even
more".[^132]

137\. Those moralizers who want to keep a tight rein on God's mercy and
grace might claim that Therese could say this because she was a saint,
but a simple person could not say the same. In that way, they excise
from the spirituality of Saint Therese its wonderful originality, which
reflects the heart of the Gospel. Sadly, in certain Christian circles we
often encounter this attempt to fit the Holy Spirit into a certain
preconceived pattern in a way that enables them to keep everything under
their supervision. Yet this astute Doctor of the Church reduces them to
silence and directly contradicts their reductive view in these clear
words: "If I had committed all possible crimes, I would always have the
same confidence; I feel that this whole multitude of offenses would be
like a drop of water thrown into a fiery furnace".[^133]


138\. To Sister Marie, who praised her generous love of God, prepared
even to embrace martyrdom, Therese responded at length in a letter that
is one of the great milestones in the history of spirituality. This page
ought to be read a thousand times over for its depth, clarity and
beauty. There, Therese helps her sister, "Marie of the Sacred Heart", to
avoid focusing this devotion on suffering, since some had presented
reparation primarily in terms of accumulating sacrifices and good works.
Therese, for her part, presents confidence as the greatest and best
offering, pleasing to the heart of Christ: "My desires of martyrdom are
nothing; they are not what give me the unlimited confidence that I feel
in my heart. They are, to tell the truth, the spiritual riches that
render one unjust, when one rests in them with complacence and one
believes that they are something great... what pleases \[Jesus\] is that
he sees me loving my littleness and my poverty, the blind hope that I
have in his mercy... That is my only treasure... If you want to feel
joy, to have an attraction for suffering, it is your consolation that
you are seeking... Understand that to be his victim of love, the weaker
one is, without desires or virtues, the more suited one is for the
workings of this consuming and transforming Love... Oh! How I would like
to be able to make you understand what I feel!\... It is confidence and
nothing but confidence that must lead us to Love".[^134]


139\. In many of her writings, Therese speaks of her struggle with forms
of spirituality overly focused on human effort, on individual merit, on
offering sacrifices and carrying out certain acts in order to "win
heaven". For her, "merit does not consist in doing or in giving much,
but rather in receiving".[^135] Let
us read once again some of these deeply meaningful texts where she
emphasizes this and presents it as a simple and rapid means of taking
hold of the Lord "by his heart".

140\. To her sister Léonie she writes, "I assure you that God is much
better than you believe. He is content with a glance, a sigh of love...
As for me, I find perfection very easy to practise because I have
understood it is a matter of taking hold of Jesus by his heart... Look
at a little child who has just annoyed his mother... If he comes to her,
holding out his little arms, smiling and saying: 'Kiss me, I will not do
it again', will his mother be able not to press him to her heart
tenderly and forget his childish mischief? However, she knows her dear
little one will do it again on the next occasion, but this does not
matter; if he takes her again by her heart, he will not be punished".[^136]


141\. So too, in a letter to Father Adolphe Roulland she writes, "\[M\]y
way is all confidence and love. I do not understand souls who fear a
friend so tender. At times, when I am reading certain spiritual
treatises in which perfection is shown through a thousand obstacles,
surrounded by a crowd of illusions, my poor little mind quickly tires; I
close the learned book that is breaking my head and drying up my heart,
and I take up Holy Scripture. Then all seems luminous to me; a single
word uncovers for my soul infinite horizons, perfection seems simple to
me. I see that it is sufficient to recognize one's nothingness and to
abandon oneself like a child into God's arms".[^137]


142\. In yet another letter, she relates this to the love shown by a
parent: "I do not believe that the heart of \[a\] father could resist
the filial confidence of his child, whose sincerity and love he knows.
He realizes, however, that more than once his son will fall into the
same faults, but he is prepared to pardon him always, if his son always
takes him by his heart".[^138]

## RESONANCES WITHIN THE SOCIETY OF JESUS

143\. We have seen how Saint Claude de La Colombière combined the
spiritual experience of Saint Margaret Mary with the aim of the
Spiritual Exercises. I believe that the place of the Sacred Heart in the
history of the Society of Jesus merits a few brief words.

144\. The spirituality of the Society of Jesus has always proposed an
"interior knowledge of the Lord in order to love and follow him more
fully".[^139] Saint Ignatius invites
us in his Spiritual Exercises to place ourselves before the Gospel that
tells us that, "\[Christ's\] side was pierced by the lance and blood and
water flowed forth".[^140] When
retreatants contemplate the wounded side of the crucified Lord, Ignatius
suggests that they enter into the heart of Christ. Thus we have a way to
enlarge our own hearts, recommended by one who was a "master of
affections", to use the words of Saint Peter Faber in one of his letters
to Saint Ignatius.[^141] Father Juan
Alfonso de Polanco echoed that same expression in his biography of Saint
Ignatius: "He \[Cardinal Gasparo Contarini\] realized that in Father
Ignatius he had encountered a master of affections".[^142]
 The colloquies that Saint
Ignatius proposed are an essential part of this training of the heart,
for in them we sense and savour with the heart a Gospel message and
converse about it with the Lord. Saint Ignatius tells us that we can
share our concerns with the Lord and seek his counsel. Anyone who
follows the Exercises can readily see that they involve a dialogue,
heart to heart.

145\. Saint Ignatius brings his contemplations to a crescendo at the
foot of the cross and invites the retreatant to ask the crucified Lord
with great affection, "as one friend to another, as a servant to his
master", what he or she must do for him.[^143]
 The progression of the Exercises culminates in the
"Contemplation to Attain Love", which gives rise to thanksgiving and the
offering of one's "memory, understanding and will" to the heart which is
the fount and origin of every good thing.[^144]
 This interior contemplation is
not the fruit of our understanding and effort, but is to be implored as
a gift.

146\. This same experience inspired the great succession of Jesuit
priests who spoke explicitly of the heart of Jesus: Saint Francis
Borgia, Saint Peter Faber, Saint Alphonsus Rodriguez, Father Álvarez de
Paz, Father Vincent Carafa, Father Kasper Drużbicki and countless
others. In 1883, the Jesuits declared that, "the Society of Jesus
accepts and receives with an overflowing spirit of joy and gratitude the
most agreeable duty entrusted to it by our Lord Jesus Christ to
practise, promote and propagate devotion to his divine heart".[^145]
 In September 1871, Father
Pieter Jan Beckx consecrated the Society to the Sacred Heart of Jesus
and, as a sign that it remains an outstanding element in the life of the
Society, Father Pedro Arrupe renewed that consecration in 1972, with a
conviction that he explained in these words: "I therefore wish to say to
the Society something about which I feel I cannot remain silent. From my
novitiate on, I have always been convinced that what we call devotion to
the Sacred Heart contains a symbolic expression of what is most profound
in Ignatian spirituality, and of an extraordinary efficacy -- *ultra
quam speraverint* -- both for its own perfection and for its apostolic
fruitfulness. I continue to have this same conviction... In this
devotion I encounter one of the deepest sources of my interior life".[^146]


147\. When Saint John Paul II urged "all the members of the Society to
be even more zealous in promoting this devotion, which corresponds more
than ever to the expectations of our time", he did so because he
recognized the profound connection between devotion to the heart of
Christ and Ignatian spirituality. For "the desire to 'know the Lord
intimately' and to 'have a conversation' with him, heart to heart, is
characteristic of the Ignatian spiritual and apostolic dynamism, thanks
to the Spiritual Exercises, and this dynamism is wholly at the service
of the love of the heart of God".[^147]


## A BROAD CURRENT OF THE INTERIOR LIFE

148\. Devotion to the heart of Christ reappears in the spiritual journey
of many saints, all quite different from each other; in every one of
them, the devotion takes on new hues. Saint Vincent de Paul, for
example, used to say that what God desires is the heart: "God asks
primarily for our heart -- our heart -- and that is what counts. How is
it that a man who has no wealth will have greater merit than someone who
has great possessions that he gives up? Because the one who has nothing
does it with greater love; and that is what God especially wants..."[^148]
 This means allowing one's
heart to be united to that of Christ. "What blessing should a Sister not
hope for from God if she does her utmost to put her heart in the state
of being united with the heart of our Lord!"[^149]


149\. At times, we may be tempted to consider this mystery of love as an
admirable relic from the past, a fine spirituality suited to other
times. Yet we need to remind ourselves constantly that, as a saintly
missionary once said, "this divine heart, which let itself be pierced by
an enemy's lance in order to pour forth through that sacred wound the
sacraments by which the Church was formed, has never ceased to love".[^150]
 More recent saints, like Saint
Pius of Pietrelcina, Saint Teresa of Calcutta and many others, have
spoken with deep devotion of the heart of Christ. Here I would also
mention the experiences of Saint Faustina Kowalska, which re-propose
devotion to the heart of Christ by greatly emphasizing the glorious life
of the risen Lord and his divine mercy. Inspired by her experiences and
the spiritual legacy of Saint Józef Sebastian Pelczar (1842-1924),[^151]
[Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) intimately
linked his reflections on divine mercy with devotion to the heart of
Christ: "The Church seems in a singular way to profess the mercy of God
and to venerate it when she directs herself to the heart of Christ. In
fact, it is precisely this drawing close to Christ in the mystery of his
heart which enables us to dwell on this point of the revelation of the
merciful love of the Father, a revelation that constituted the central
content of the messianic mission of the Son of Man".[^152]
 Saint John Paul also spoke of
the Sacred Heart in very personal terms, acknowledging that, "it has
spoken to me ever since my youth".[^153]


150\. The enduring relevance of devotion to the heart of Christ is
especially evident in the work of evangelization and education carried
out by the numerous male and female religious congregations whose
origins were marked by this profoundly Christological devotion.
Mentioning all of them by name would be an endless undertaking. Let us
simply consider two examples taken at random: "The Founder \[Saint
Daniel Comboni\] discovered in the mystery of the heart of Jesus the
source of strength for his missionary commitment".[^154]
 "Caught up as we are in the
desires of the heart of Jesus, we want people to grow in dignity, as
human beings and as children of God. Our starting point is the Gospel,
with all that it demands from us of love, forgiveness and justice, and
of solidarity with those who are poor and rejected by the world".[^155]
 So too, the many shrines
worldwide that are consecrated to the heart of Christ continue to be an
impressive source of renewal in prayer and spiritual fervour. To all
those who in any way are associated with these spaces of faith and
charity I send my paternal blessing.

## THE DEVOTION OF CONSOLATION

151\. The wound in Christ's side, the wellspring of living water,
remains open in the risen body of the Saviour. The deep wound inflicted
by the lance and the wounds of the crown of thorns that customarily
appear in representations of the Sacred Heart are an inseparable part of
this devotion, in which we contemplate the love of Christ who offered
himself in sacrifice to the very end. The heart of the risen Lord
preserves the signs of that complete self-surrender, which entailed
intense sufferings for our sake. It is natural, then, that the faithful
should wish to respond not only to this immense outpouring of love, but
also to the suffering that the Lord chose to endure for the sake of that
love.

### *With Jesus on the cross*

152\. It is fitting to recover one particular aspect of the spirituality
that has accompanied devotion to the heart of Christ, namely, the
interior desire to offer consolation to that heart. Here I will not
discuss the practice of "reparation", which I deem better suited to the
social dimension of this devotion to be discussed in the next chapter. I
would like instead to concentrate on the desire often felt in the hearts
of the faithful who lovingly contemplate the mystery of Christ's passion
and experience it as a mystery which is not only recollected but becomes
present to us by grace, or better, allows us to be mystically present at
the moment of our redemption. If we truly love the Lord, how could we
not desire to console him?

153\. Pope [Pius XI](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en.html)
wished to ground this particular devotion in the realization that the
mystery of our redemption by Christ's passion transcends, by God's
grace, all boundaries of time and space. On the cross, Jesus offered
himself for all sins, including those yet to be committed, including our
own sins. In the same way, the acts we now offer for his consolation,
also transcending time, touch his wounded heart. "If, because of our
sins too, as yet in the future but already foreseen, the soul of Jesus
became sorrowful unto death, it cannot be doubted that at the same time
he derived some solace from our reparation, likewise foreseen, at the
moment when 'there appeared to him an angel from heaven' ( *Lk* 22:43),
in order that his heart, oppressed with weariness and anguish, might
find consolation. And so even now, in a wondrous yet true manner, we can
and ought to console that Most Sacred Heart, which is continually
wounded by the sins of thankless men".[^156]


### *Reasons of the heart*

154\. It might appear to some that this aspect of devotion to the Sacred
Heart lacks a firm theological basis, yet the heart has its reasons.
Here the *sensus fidelium* perceives something mysterious, beyond our
human logic, and realizes that the passion of Christ is not merely an
event of the past, but one in which we can share through faith.
Meditation on Christ's self-offering on the cross involves, for
Christian piety, something much more than mere remembrance. This
conviction has a solid theological grounding.[^157]
 We can also add the
recognition of our own sins, which Jesus took upon his bruised
shoulders, and our inadequacy in the face of that timeless love, which
is always infinitely greater.

155\. We may also question how we can pray to the Lord of life, risen
from the dead and reigning in glory, while at the same time comforting
him in the midst of his sufferings. Here we need to realize that his
risen heart preserves its wound as a constant memory, and that the
working of grace makes possible an experience that is not restricted to
a single moment of the past. In pondering this, we find ourselves
invited to take a mystical path that transcends our mental limitations
yet remains firmly grounded in the word of God. [Pope Pius
XI](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en.html) makes this clear:
"How can these acts of reparation offer solace now, when Christ is
already reigning in the beatitude of heaven? To this question, we may
answer in the words of Saint Augustine, which are very apposite here --
'Give me the one who loves, and he will understand what I say'. Anyone
possessed of great love for God, and who looks back to the past, can
dwell in meditation on Christ, and see him labouring for man, sorrowing,
suffering the greatest hardships, 'for us men and for our salvation',
well-nigh worn out with sadness, with anguish, nay 'bruised for our
sins' ( *Is* 53:5), and bringing us healing by those very bruises. The
more the faithful ponder all these things the more clearly they see that
the sins of mankind, whenever they were committed, were the reason why
Christ was delivered up to death".[^158]


156\. Those words of [Pius
XI](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en.html) merit serious
consideration. When Scripture states that believers who fail to live in
accordance with their faith "are crucifying again the Son of God" (*Heb*
6:6), or when Paul, offering his sufferings for the sake of others, says
that, "in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's
afflictions" (*Col* 1:24), or again, when Christ in his passion prays
not only for his disciples at that time, but also for "those who will
believe in me through their word" (*Jn* 17:20), all these statements
challenge our usual way of thinking. They show us that it is not
possible to sever the past completely from the present, however
difficult our minds find this to grasp. The Gospel, in all its richness,
was written not only for our prayerful meditation, but also to enable us
to experience its reality in our works of love and in our interior life.
This is certainly the case with regard to the mystery of Christ's death
and resurrection. The temporal distinctions that our minds employ appear
incapable of embracing the fullness of this experience of faith, which
is the basis both of our union with Christ in his suffering and of the
strength, consolation and friendship that we enjoy with him in his risen
life.

157\. We see, then, the unity of the paschal mystery in these two
inseparable and mutually enriching aspects. The one mystery, present by
grace in both these dimensions, ensures that whenever we offer some
suffering of our own to Christ for his consolation, that suffering is
illuminated and transfigured in the paschal light of his love. We share
in this mystery in our own life because Christ himself first chose to
share in that life. He wished to experience first, as Head, what he
would then experience in his Body, the Church: both our wounds and our
consolations. When we live in God's grace, this mutual sharing becomes
for us a spiritual experience. In a word, the risen Lord, by the working
of his grace, mysteriously unites us to his passion. The hearts of the
faithful, who experience the joy of the resurrection, yet at the same
time desire to share in the Lord's passion, understand this. They desire
to share in his sufferings by offering him the sufferings, the
struggles, the disappointments and the fears that are part of their own
lives. Nor do they experience this as isolated individuals, since their
sufferings are also a participation in the suffering of the mystical
Body of Christ, the holy pilgrim People of God, which shares in the
passion of Christ in every time and place. The devotion of consolation,
then, is in no way ahistorical or abstract; it becomes flesh and blood
in the Church's pilgrimage through history.

### *Compunction*

158\. The natural desire to console Christ, which begins with our sorrow
in contemplating what he endured for us, grows with the honest
acknowledgment of our bad habits, compulsions, attachments, weak faith,
vain goals and, together with our actual sins, the failure of our hearts
to respond to the Lord's love and his plan for our lives. This
experience proves purifying, for love needs the purification of tears
that, in the end, leave us more desirous of God and less obsessed with
ourselves.

159\. In this way, we see that the deeper our desire to console the
Lord, the deeper will be our sincere sense of "compunction". Compunction
is "not a feeling of guilt that makes us discouraged or obsessed with
our unworthiness, but a beneficial 'piercing' that purifies and heals
the heart. Once we acknowledge our sin, our hearts can be opened to the
working of the Holy Spirit, the source of living water that wells up
within us and brings tears to our eyes... This does not mean weeping in
self-pity, as we are so often tempted to do... To shed tears of
compunction means seriously to repent of grieving God by our sins;
recognizing that we always remain in God's debt... Just as drops of
water can wear down a stone, so tears can slowly soften hardened hearts.
Here we see the miracle of sorrow, that 'salutary sorrow' which brings
great peace\... Compunction, then, is not our work but a grace and, as
such, it must be sought in prayer."[^159]
 It means, "asking for sorrow in company with Christ in his
sorrow, for anguish with Christ in his anguish, for tears and a deep
sense of pain at the great pains that Christ endured for my sake".[^160]


160\. I ask, then, that no one make light of the fervent devotion of the
holy faithful people of God, which in its popular piety seeks to console
Christ. I also encourage everyone to consider whether there might be
greater reasonableness, truth and wisdom in certain demonstrations of
love that seek to console the Lord than in the cold, distant, calculated
and nominal acts of love that are at times practised by those who claim
to possess a more reflective, sophisticated and mature faith.

### *Consoled ourselves in order to console others*

161\. In contemplating the heart of Christ and his self-surrender even
to death, we ourselves find great consolation. The grief that we feel in
our hearts gives way to complete trust and, in the end, what endures is
gratitude, tenderness, peace; what endures is Christ's love reigning in
our lives. Compunction, then, "is not a source of anxiety but of healing
for the soul, since it acts as a balm on the wounds of sin, preparing us
to receive the caress of the Lord".[^161]
 Our sufferings are joined to the suffering of Christ on the
cross. If we believe that grace can bridge every distance, this means
that Christ by his sufferings united himself to the sufferings of his
disciples in every time and place. In this way, whenever we endure
suffering, we can also experience the interior consolation of knowing
that Christ suffers with us. In seeking to console him, we will find
ourselves consoled.

162\. At some point, however, in our contemplation, we should likewise
hear the urgent plea of the Lord: "Comfort, comfort my people!" (*Is*
40:1). As Saint Paul tells us, God offers us consolation "so that we may
be able to console those who are in any affliction, with the consolation
by which we ourselves are consoled by God" (*2 Cor* 1:4).

163\. This then challenges us to seek a deeper understanding of the
communitarian, social and missionary dimension of all authentic devotion
to the heart of Christ. For even as Christ's heart leads us to the
Father, it sends us forth to our brothers and sisters. In the fruits of
service, fraternity and mission that the heart of Christ inspires in our
lives, the will of the Father is fulfilled. In this way, we come full
circle: "My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit" (*Jn*
15:8).

# CHAPTER FIVE

## LOVE FOR LOVE

164\. In the spiritual experiences of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, we
encounter, along with an ardent declaration of love for Jesus Christ, a
profoundly personal and challenging invitation to entrust our lives to
the Lord. The knowledge that we are loved, and our complete confidence
in that love, in no way lessens our desire to respond generously,
despite our frailty and our many shortcomings.

## A LAMENT AND A REQUEST

165\. Beginning with his second great apparition to Saint Margaret Mary,
Jesus spoke of the sadness he feels because his great love for humanity
receives in exchange "nothing but ingratitude and indifference",
"coldness and contempt". And this, he added, "is more grievous to me
than all that I endured in my Passion".[^162]


166\. Jesus spoke of his thirst for love and revealed that his heart is
not indifferent to the way we respond to that thirst. In his words, "I
thirst, but with a thirst so ardent to be loved by men in the Most
Blessed Sacrament, that this thirst consumes me; and I have not
encountered anyone who makes an effort, according to my desire, to
quench my thirst, giving back a return for my love".[^163]
 Jesus asks for love. Once the
faithful heart realizes this, its spontaneous response is one of love,
not a desire to multiply sacrifices or simply discharge a burdensome
duty: "I received from my God excessive graces of his love, and I felt
moved by the desire to respond to some of them and to respond with love
for love".[^164] As my Predecessor
[Leo XIII](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en.html) pointed out,
through the image of his Sacred Heart, the love of Christ "moves us to
return love for love".[^165]

## EXTENDING CHRIST'S LOVE TO OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS

167\. We need once more to take up the word of God and to realize, in
doing so, that our best response to the love of Christ's heart is to
love our brothers and sisters. There is no greater way for us to return
love for love. The Scriptures make this patently clear:

>
> "Just as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did
> it to me" (*Mt* 25:40).
>
> "For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment: 'You shall
> love your neighbour as yourself'" (*Gal* 5:14).
> 
> "We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one
> another. Whoever does not love abides in death" (*1* *Jn* 3:14).
> 
> "Those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot
> love God whom they have not seen" (*1 Jn* 4:20).
> 

168\. Love for our brothers and sisters is not simply the fruit of our
own efforts; it demands the transformation of our selfish hearts. This
realization gave rise to the oft-repeated prayer: "Jesus, make our
hearts more like your own". Saint Paul, for his part, urged his hearers
to pray not for the strength to do good works, but "to have the same
mind among you that was in Christ Jesus" (*Phil* 2:5).

169\. We need to remember that in the Roman Empire many of the poor,
foreigners and others who lived on the fringes of society met with
respect, affection and care from Christians. This explains why the
apostate emperor Julian, in one of his letters, acknowledged that one
reason why Christians were respected and imitated was the assistance
they gave the poor and strangers, who were ordinarily ignored and
treated with contempt. For Julian, it was intolerable that the
Christians whom he despised, "in addition to feeding their own, also
feed our poor and needy, who receive no help from us".[^166]
 The emperor thus insisted on
the need to create charitable institutions to compete with those of the
Christians and thus gain the respect of society: "There should be
instituted in each city many accommodations so that the immigrants may
enjoy our philanthropy... and make the Greeks accustomed to such works
of generosity".[^167] Julian did not
achieve his objective, no doubt because underlying those works there was
nothing comparable to the Christian charity that respected the unique
dignity of each person.

170\. By associating with the lowest ranks of society (cf. *Mt*
25:31-46), "Jesus brought the great novelty of recognizing the dignity
of every person, especially those who were considered 'unworthy'. This
new principle in human history -- which emphasizes that individuals are
even more 'worthy' of our respect and love when they are weak, scorned,
or suffering, even to the point of losing the human 'figure' -- has
changed the face of the world. It has given life to institutions that
take care of those who find themselves in disadvantaged conditions, such
as abandoned infants, orphans, the elderly who are left without
assistance, the mentally ill, people with incurable diseases or severe
deformities, and those living on the streets".[^168]


171\. In contemplating the pierced heart of the Lord, who "took our
infirmities and bore our diseases" ( *Mt* 8:17), we too are inspired to
be more attentive to the sufferings and needs of others, and confirmed
in our efforts to share in his work of liberation as instruments for the
spread of his love.[^169] As we
meditate on Christ's self-offering for the sake of all, we are naturally
led to ask why we too should not be ready to give our lives for others:
"We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us -- and that we
ought to lay down our lives for one another" ( *1 Jn* 3:16).

## ECHOES IN THE HISTORY OF SPIRITUALITY

172\. This bond between devotion to the heart of Jesus and commitment to
our brothers and sisters has been a constant in the history of Christian
spirituality. Let us consider a few examples.

### *Being a fountain from which others can drink*

173\. Starting with Origen, various Fathers of the Church reflected on
the words of John 7:38 -- "out of his heart shall flow rivers of living
water" -- which refer to those who, having drunk of Christ, put their
faith in him. Our union with Christ is meant not only to satisfy our own
thirst, but also to make us springs of living water for others. Origen
wrote that Christ fulfils his promise by making fountains of fresh water
well up within us: "The human soul, made in the image of God, can itself
contain and pour forth wells, fountains and rivers".[^170]


174\. Saint Ambrose recommended drinking deeply of Christ, "in order
that the spring of water welling up to eternal life may overflow in
you".[^171] Marius Victorinus was
convinced that the Holy Spirit has given of himself in such abundance
that, "whoever receives him becomes a heart that pours forth rivers of
living water".[^172] Saint Augustine
saw this stream flowing from the believer as benevolence.[^173]
 Saint Thomas Aquinas thus
maintained that whenever someone "hastens to share various gifts of
grace received from God, living water flows from his heart".[^174]


175\. Although "the sacrifice offered on the cross in loving obedience
renders most abundant and infinite satisfaction for the sins of
mankind",[^175] the Church, born of
the heart of Christ, prolongs and bestows, in every time and place, the
fruits of that one redemptive passion, which lead men and women to
direct union with the Lord.

176\. In the heart of the Church, the mediation of Mary, as our
intercessor and mother, can only be understood as "a sharing in the one
source, which is the mediation of Christ himself",[^176]
 the sole Redeemer. For this
reason, "the Church does not hesitate to profess the subordinate role of
Mary".[^177] Devotion to the heart
of Mary in no way detracts from the sole worship due the heart of
Christ, but rather increases it: "Mary's function as mother of humanity
in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of Christ, but
rather shows its power".[^178]
Thanks to the abundant graces streaming from the open side of Christ, in
different ways the Church, the Virgin Mary and all believers become
themselves streams of living water. In this way, Christ displays his
glory in and through our littleness.

### *Fraternity and mysticism*

177\. Saint Bernard, in exhorting us to union with the heart of Christ,
draws upon the richness of this devotion to call for a conversion
grounded in love. Bernard believed that our affections, enslaved by
pleasures, may nonetheless be transformed and set free, not by blind
obedience to a commandment but rather in response to the delectable love
of Christ. Evil is overcome by good, conquered by the flowering of love:
"Love the Lord your God with the full and deep affection of all your
heart; love him with your mind wholly alert and intent; love him with
all your strength, so much so that you would not even fear to die for
love of him... Your affection for the Lord Jesus should be both sweet
and intimate, to oppose the sweet enticements of the sensual life.
Sweetness conquers sweetness, as one nail drives out another".[^179]


178\. Saint Francis de Sales was particularly taken by Jesus' words,
"Learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart" ( *Mt* 11:29). Even
in the most simple and ordinary things, he said, we can "steal" the
Lord's heart. "Those who would serve him acceptably must give heed not
only to lofty and important matters, but to things mean and little,
since by both alike we may win his heart and love... I mean the acts of
daily forbearance, the headache, the toothache, the heavy cold; the
tiresome peculiarities of a husband or wife, the broken glass, the loss
of a ring, a handkerchief, a glove; the sneer of a neighbour; the effort
of going to bed early in order to rise early for prayer or communion,
the little shyness some people feel in openly performing religious
duties... Be sure that all these sufferings, small as they are, if
accepted lovingly, are most pleasing to God's goodness".[^180]
 Ultimately, however, our
response to the love of the heart of Christ is manifested in love of our
neighbour: "a love that is firm, constant, steady, unconcerned with
trivial matters or people's station in life, not subject to changes or
animosity... Our Lord loves us unceasingly, puts up with so many of our
defects and our flaws. Precisely because of this, we must do the same
with our brothers and sisters, never tiring of putting up with them".[^181]


179\. Saint Charles de Foucauld sought to imitate Jesus by living and
acting as he did, in a constant effort to do what Jesus would have done
in his place. Only by being conformed to the sentiments of the heart of
Christ could he fully achieve this goal. Here too we find the idea of
"love for love". In his words, "I desire sufferings in order to return
love for love, to imitate him... to enter into his work, to offer myself
with him, the nothingness that I am, as a sacrifice, as a victim, for
the sanctification of men".[^182]
The desire to bring the love of Jesus to others, his missionary outreach
to the poorest and most forgotten of our world, led him to take as his
emblem the words, "Iesus-Caritas", with the symbol of the heart of
Christ surmounted by a cross.[^183]
Nor was this a light decision: "With all my strength I try to show and
prove to these poor lost brethren that our religion is all charity, all
fraternity, and that its emblem is a heart".[^184]
 He wanted to settle with other
brothers "in Morocco, in the name of the heart of Jesus".[^185]
 In this way, their
evangelizing work could radiate outwards: "Charity has to radiate from
our fraternities, as it radiates from the heart of Jesus".[^186]
 This desire gradually made him
a "universal brother". Allowing himself to be shaped by the heart of
Christ, he sought to shelter the whole of suffering humanity in his
fraternal heart: "Our heart, like that of Jesus, must embrace all men
and women".[^187] "The love of the
heart of Jesus for men and women, the love that he demonstrated in his
passion, this is what we need to have for all human beings".[^188]


180\. Father Henri Huvelin, the spiritual director of Saint Charles de
Foucauld, observed that, "when our Lord dwells in a heart, he gives it
such sentiments, and this heart reaches out to the least of our brothers
and sisters. Such was the heart of Saint Vincent de Paul... When our
Lord lives in the soul of a priest, he makes him reach out to the poor".[^189]
 It is important to realize
that the apostolic zeal of Saint Vincent, as Father Huvelin describes
it, was also nurtured by devotion to the heart of Christ. Saint Vincent
urged his confreres to "find in the heart of our Lord a word of
consolation for the poor sick person".[^190]
 If that word is to be convincing, our own heart must first
have been changed by the love and tenderness of the heart of Christ.
Saint Vincent often reiterated this conviction in his homilies and
counsels, and it became a notable feature of the Constitutions of his
Congregation: "We should make a great effort to learn the following
lesson, also taught by Christ: 'Learn from me, for I am gentle and
humble of heart'. We should remember that he himself said that by
gentleness we inherit the earth. If we act on this, we will win people
over so that they will turn to the Lord. That will not happen if we
treat people harshly or sharply".[^191]


## REPARATION: BUILDING ON THE RUINS

181\. All that has been said thus far enables us to understand in the
light of God's word the proper meaning of the "reparation" to the heart
of Christ that the Lord expects us, with the help of his grace, to
"offer". The question has been much discussed, but [Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) has given us a
clear response that can guide Christians today towards a spirit of
reparation more closely attuned to the Gospels.

### *The social significance of reparation to the heart of Christ*

182. [Saint John
Paul](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) explained
that by entrusting ourselves together to the heart of Christ, "over the
ruins accumulated by hatred and violence, the greatly desired
civilization of love, the Kingdom of the heart of Christ, can be built".
This clearly requires that we "unite filial love for God and love of
neighbour", and indeed this is "the true reparation asked by the heart
of the Saviour".[^192] In union with
Christ, amid the ruins we have left in this world by our sins, we are
called to build a new civilization of love. That is what it means to
make reparation as the heart of Christ would have us do. Amid the
devastation wrought by evil, the heart of Christ desires that we
cooperate with him in restoring goodness and beauty to our world.

183\. All sin harms the Church and society; as a result, "every sin can
undoubtedly be considered as a social sin" and this is especially true
for those sins that "by their very matter constitute a direct attack on
one's neighbour".[^193] [Saint John
Paul II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) explained
that the repetition of these sins against others often consolidates a
"structure of sin" that has an effect on the development of peoples.[^194]
 Frequently, this is part of a
dominant mind-set that considers normal or reasonable what is merely
selfishness and indifference. This then gives rise to social alienation:
"A society is alienated if its forms of social organization, production
and consumption make it more difficult to offer the gift of self and to
establish solidarity between people".[^195]
 It is not only a moral norm that leads us to expose and resist
these alienated social structures and to support efforts within society
to restore and consolidate the common good. Rather, it is our
"conversion of heart" that "imposes the obligation"[^196]
 to repair these structures. It
is our response to the love of the heart of Jesus, which teaches us to
love in turn.

184\. Precisely because evangelical reparation possesses this vital
social dimension, our acts of love, service and reconciliation, in order
to be truly reparative, need to be inspired, motivated and empowered by
Christ. [Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) also observed
that "to build the civilization of love",[^197]
 our world today needs the
heart of Christ. Christian reparation cannot be understood simply as a
congeries of external works, however indispensable and at times
admirable they may be. These need a "mystique", a soul, a meaning that
grants them strength, drive and tireless creativity. They need the life,
the fire and the light that radiate from the heart of Christ.

### *Mending wounded hearts*

185\. Nor is a merely outward reparation sufficient, either for our
world or for the heart of Christ. If each of us considers his or her own
sins and their effect on others, we will realize that repairing the harm
done to this world also calls for a desire to mend wounded hearts where
the deepest harm was done, and the hurt is most painful.

186\. A spirit of reparation thus "leads us to hope that every wound can
be healed, however deep it may be. Complete reparation may at times seem
impossible, such as when goods or loved ones are definitively lost, or
when certain situations have become irremediable. Yet the intention to
make amends, and to do so in a concrete way, is essential for the
process of reconciliation and a return to peace of heart".[^198]


### *The beauty of asking forgiveness*

187\. Good intentions are not enough. There has to be an inward desire
that finds expression in our outward actions. "Reparation, if it is to
be Christian, to touch the offended person's heart and not be a simple
act of commutative justice, presupposes two demanding
things: acknowledging our guilt and asking forgiveness... It is from the
honest acknowledgment of the wrong done to our brother or sister, and
from the profound and sincere realization that love has been
compromised, that the desire to make amends arises".[^199]


188\. We should never think that acknowledging our sins before others is
somehow demeaning or offensive to our human dignity. On the contrary, it
demands that we stop deceiving ourselves and acknowledge our past for
what it is, marred by sin, especially in those cases when we caused hurt
to our brothers and sisters. "Self-accusation is part of Christian
wisdom... It is pleasing to the Lord, because the Lord accepts a
contrite heart".[^200]

189\. Part of this spirit of reparation is the custom of asking
forgiveness from our brothers and sisters, which demonstrates great
nobility amid our human weakness. Asking forgiveness is a means of
healing relationships, for it "re-opens dialogue and manifests the will
to re-establish the bond of fraternal charity... It touches the heart of
our brother or sister, brings consolation and inspires acceptance of the
forgiveness requested. Even if the irreparable cannot be completely
repaired, love can always be reborn, making the hurt bearable".[^201]


190\. A heart capable of compunction will grow in fraternity and
solidarity. Otherwise, "we regress and grow old within", whereas when
"our prayer becomes simpler and deeper, grounded in adoration and wonder
in the presence of God, we grow and mature. We become less attached to
ourselves and more attached to Christ. Made poor in spirit, we draw
closer to the poor, those who are dearest to God".[^202]
 This leads to a true spirit of
reparation, for "those who feel compunction of heart increasingly feel
themselves brothers and sisters to all the sinners of the world;
renouncing their airs of superiority and harsh judgments, they are
filled with a burning desire to show love and make reparation".[^203]
 The sense of solidarity born
of compunction also enables reconciliation to take place. The person who
is capable of compunction, "rather than feeling anger and scandal at the
failings of our brothers and sisters, weeps for their sins. There occurs
a sort of reversal, where the natural tendency to be indulgent with
ourselves and inflexible with others is overturned and, by God's grace,
we become strict with ourselves and merciful towards others".[^204]


## REPARATION: AN EXTENSION OF THE HEART OF CHRIST

191\. There is another, complementary, approach to reparation, which
allows us to set it in an even more direct relationship with the heart
of Christ, without excluding the aspect of concrete commitment to our
brothers and sisters.

192\. Elsewhere I have suggested that, "God has in some way sought to
limit himself in such a way that many of the things we think of as
evils, dangers or sources of suffering, are in reality part of the pains
of childbirth which he uses to draw us into the act of cooperation with
the Creator".[^205] This cooperation
on our part can allow the power and the love of God to expand in our
lives and in the world, whereas our refusal or indifference can prevent
it. Several passages of the Bible express this metaphorically, as when
the Lord cries out, "If only you would return to me, O Israel!" (cf.
*Jer* 4:1). Or when, confronted with rejection by his people, he says,
"My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender" (
*Hos* 11:8).

193\. Even though it is not possible to speak of new suffering on the
part of the glorified Lord, "the paschal mystery of Christ... and all
that Christ is -- all that he did and suffered for all men --
participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends all times while
being made present in them all".[^206]
 We can say that he has allowed the expansive glory of his
resurrection to be limited and the diffusion of his immense and burning
love to be contained, in order to leave room for our free cooperation
with his heart. Our rejection of his love erects a barrier to that
gracious gift, whereas our trusting acceptance of it opens a space, a
channel enabling it to pour into our hearts. Our rejection or
indifference limits the effects of his power and the fruitfulness of his
love in us. If he does not encounter openness and confidence in me, his
love is deprived -- because he himself has willed it -- of its
extension, unique and unrepeatable, in my life and in this world, where
he calls me to make him present. Again, this does not stem from any
weakness on his part but rather from his infinite freedom, his
mysterious power and his perfect love for each of us. When God's power
is revealed in the weakness of our human freedom, "only faith can
discern it".[^207]

194\. Saint Margaret Mary recounted that, in one of Christ's
appearances, he spoke of his heart's passionate love for us, telling her
that, "unable to contain the flames of his burning charity, he must
spread them abroad".[^208] Since the
Lord, who can do all things, desired in his divine freedom to require
our cooperation, reparation can be understood as our removal of the
obstacles we place before the expansion of Christ's love in the world by
our lack of trust, gratitude and self-sacrifice.

### *An Oblation to Love*

195\. To help us reflect more deeply on this mystery, we can turn once
more to the luminous spirituality of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus.
Therese was aware that in certain quarters an extreme form of reparation
had developed, based on a willingness to offer oneself in sacrifice for
others, and to become in some sense a "lightning rod" for the
chastisements of divine justice. In her words, "I thought about the
souls who offer themselves as victims of God's justice in order to turn
away the punishments reserved to sinners, drawing them upon themselves".[^209]
 However, as great and generous
as such an offering might appear, she did not find it overly appealing:
"I was far from feeling attracted to making it".[^210]
 So great an emphasis on God's
justice might eventually lead to the notion that Christ's sacrifice was
somehow incomplete or only partly efficacious, or that his mercy was not
sufficiently powerful.

196\. With her great spiritual insight, Saint Therese discovered that we
can offer ourselves in another way, without the need to satisfy divine
justice but by allowing the Lord's infinite love to spread freely: "O my
God! Is your disdained love going to remain closed up within your heart?
It seems to me that if you were to find souls offering themselves as
victims of holocaust to your love, you would consume them rapidly; it
seems to me, too, that you would be happy not to hold back the waves of
infinite tenderness within you".[^211]


197\. While nothing need be added to the one redemptive sacrifice of
Christ, it remains true that our free refusal can prevent the heart of
Christ from spreading the "waves of his infinite tenderness" in this
world. Again, this is because the Lord wishes to respect our freedom.
More than divine justice, it was the fact that Christ's love might be
refused that troubled the heart of Saint Therese, because for her, God's
justice is understood only in the light of his love. As we have seen,
she contemplated all God's perfections through his mercy, and thus saw
them transfigured and resplendent with love. In her words, "even his
justice (and perhaps this even more so than the others) seems to me
clothed in love".[^212]

198\. This was the origin of her Act of Oblation, not to God's justice
but to his merciful love. "I offer myself as a victim of holocaust to
your merciful love, asking you to consume me incessantly, allowing the
waves of infinite tenderness shut up within you to overflow into my
soul, and that thus I may become a martyr of your love".[^213]
 It is important to realize
that, for Therese, this was not only about allowing the heart of Christ
to fill her heart, through her complete trust, with the beauty of his
love, but also about letting that love, through her life, spread to
others and thus transform the world. Again, in her words, "In the heart
of the Church, my Mother, I shall be love... and thus my dream will be
realized".[^214] The two aspects
were inseparably united.

199\. The Lord accepted her oblation. We see that shortly thereafter she
stated that she felt an intense love for others and maintained that it
came from the heart of Christ, prolonged through her. So she told her
sister Léonie: "I love you a thousand times more tenderly than ordinary
sisters love each other, for I can love you with the heart of our
celestial spouse".[^215] Later, to
Maurice Bellière she wrote, "How I would like to make you understand the
tenderness of the heart of Jesus, what he expects from you!"[^216]


### *Integrity and Harmony*

200\. Sisters and brothers, I propose that we develop this means of
reparation, which is, in a word, to offer the heart of Christ a new
possibility of spreading in this world the flames of his ardent and
gracious love. While it remains true that reparation entails the desire
to "render compensation for the injuries inflicted on uncreated Love,
whether by negligence or grave offense",[^217]
 the most fitting way to do this is for our love to offer the
Lord a possibility of spreading, in amends for all those occasions when
his love has been rejected or refused. This involves more than simply
the "consolation" of Christ of which we spoke in the previous chapter;
it finds expression in acts of fraternal love by which we heal the
wounds of the Church and of the world. In this way, we offer the healing
power of the heart of Christ new ways of expressing itself.

201\. The sacrifices and sufferings required by these acts of love of
neighbour unite us to the passion of Christ. In this way, "by that
mystic crucifixion of which the Apostle speaks, we shall receive the
abundant fruits of its propitiation and expiation, for ourselves and for
others".[^218] Christ alone saves us
by his offering on the cross; he alone redeems us, for "there is one
God; there is also one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all" (1 *Tim* 2:5-6). The
reparation that we offer is a freely accepted participation in his
redeeming love and his one sacrifice. We thus complete in our flesh
"what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that
is, the Church" ( *Col* 1:24); and Christ himself prolongs through us
the effects of his complete and loving self-oblation.

202\. Often, our sufferings have to do with our own wounded ego. The
humility of the heart of Christ points us towards the path of abasement.
God chose to come to us in condescension and littleness. The Old
Testament had already shown us, with a variety of metaphors, a God who
enters into the heart of history and allows himself to be rejected by
his people. Christ's love was shown amid the daily life of his people,
begging, as it were, for a response, as if asking permission to manifest
his glory. Yet "perhaps only once did the Lord Jesus refer to his own
heart, in his own words. And he stresses this sole feature: 'gentleness
and lowliness', as if to say that only in this way does he wish to win
us to himself".[^219] When he said,
"Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart" ( *Mt* 11:29), he
showed us that "to make himself known, he needs our littleness, our
self-abasement".[^220]

203\. In what we have said, it is important to note several inseparable
aspects. Acts of love of neighbour, with the renunciation, self-denial,
suffering and effort that they entail, can only be such when they are
nourished by Christ's own love. He enables us to love as he loved, and
in this way he loves and serves others through us. He humbles himself to
show his love through our actions, yet even in our slightest works of
mercy, his heart is glorified and displays all its grandeur. Once our
hearts welcome the love of Christ in complete trust, and enable its fire
to spread in our lives, we become capable of loving others as Christ
did, in humility and closeness to all. In this way, Christ satisfies his
thirst and gloriously spreads the flames of his ardent and gracious love
in us and through us. How can we fail to see the magnificent harmony
present in all this?

204\. Finally, in order to appreciate this devotion in all of its
richness, it is necessary to add, in the light of what we have said
about its Trinitarian dimension, that the reparation made by Christ in
his humanity is offered to the Father through the working of the Holy
Spirit in each of us. Consequently, the reparation we offer to the heart
of Christ is directed ultimately to the Father, who is pleased to see us
united to Christ whenever we offer ourselves through him, with him and
in him.

## BRINGING LOVE TO THE WORLD

205\. The Christian message is attractive when experienced and expressed
in its totality: not simply as a refuge for pious thoughts or an
occasion for impressive ceremonies. What kind of worship would we give
to Christ if we were to rest content with an individual relationship
with him and show no interest in relieving the sufferings of others or
helping them to live a better life? Would it please the heart that so
loved us, if we were to bask in a private religious experience while
ignoring its implications for the society in which we live? Let us be
honest and accept the word of God in its fullness. On the other hand,
our work as Christians for the betterment of society should not obscure
its religious inspiration, for that, in the end, would be to seek less
for our brothers and sisters than what God desires to give them. For
this reason, we should conclude this chapter by recalling the missionary
dimension of our love for the heart of Christ.

206\. [Saint John Paul
II](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en.html) spoke of the
social dimension of devotion to the heart of Christ, but also about
"reparation, which is apostolic cooperation in the salvation of the
world".[^221] Consecration to the
heart of Christ is thus "to be seen in relation to the Church's
missionary activity, since it responds to the desire of Jesus' heart to
spread throughout the world, through the members of his Body, his
complete commitment to the Kingdom".[^222]
 As a result, "through the witness of Christians, love will be
poured into human hearts, to build up the body of Christ which is the
Church, and to build a society of justice, peace and fraternity".[^223]


207\. The flames of love of the Sacred Heart of Jesus also expand
through the Church's missionary outreach, which proclaims the message of
God's love revealed in Christ. Saint Vincent de Paul put this nicely
when he invited his disciples to pray to the Lord for "this spirit, this
heart that causes us to go everywhere, this heart of the Son of God, the
heart of our Lord, that disposes us to go as he went... he sends us,
like \[the apostles\], to bring fire everywhere".[^224]


208\. [Saint Paul VI](https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it.html),
addressing religious Congregations dedicated to the spread of devotion
to the Sacred Heart, made the following observation. "There can be no
doubt that pastoral commitment and missionary zeal will fan into flame,
if priests and laity alike, in their desire to spread the glory of God,
contemplate the example of eternal love that Christ has shown us, and
direct their efforts to make all men and women sharers in the
unfathomable riches of Christ".[^225]
 As we contemplate the Sacred Heart, mission becomes a matter
of love. For the greatest danger in mission is that, amid all the things
we say and do, we fail to bring about a joyful encounter with the love
of Christ who embraces us and saves us.

209\. Mission, as a radiation of the love of the heart of Christ,
requires missionaries who are themselves in love and who, enthralled by
Christ, feel bound to share this love that has changed their lives. They
are impatient when time is wasted discussing secondary questions or
concentrating on truths and rules, because their greatest concern is to
share what they have experienced. They want others to perceive the
goodness and beauty of the Beloved through their efforts, however
inadequate they may be. Is that not the case with any lover? We can take
as an example the words with which Dante Alighieri sought to express
this logic of love:

> 
> *"Io dico che, pensando al suo valore*
> 
> *amor si dolce si mi si fa sentire,*
> 
> *che s'io allora non perdessi ardire*
> 
> *farei parlando innamorar la gente"*.[^226]
> 

210\. To be able to speak of Christ, by witness or by word, in such a
way that others seek to love him, is the greatest desire of every
missionary of souls. This dynamism of love has nothing to do with
proselytism; the words of a lover do not disturb others, they do not
make demands or oblige, they only lead others to marvel at such love.
With immense respect for their freedom and dignity, the lover simply
waits for them to inquire about the love that has filled his or her life
with such great joy.

211\. Christ asks you never to be ashamed to tell others, with all due
discretion and respect, about your friendship with him. He asks that you
dare to tell others how good and beautiful it is that you found him.
"Everyone who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge
before my Father in heaven" (*Mt* 10:32). For a heart that loves, this
is not a duty but an irrepressible need: "Woe to me if I do not proclaim
the Gospel!" (*1 Cor* 9:16). "Within me there is something like a
burning fire shut up in my bones; I am weary with holding it in, and I
cannot" (*Jer* 20:9).

### *In communion of service*

212\. We should not think of this mission of sharing Christ as something
only between Jesus and me. Mission is experienced in fellowship with our
communities and with the whole Church. If we turn aside from the
community, we will be turning aside from Jesus. If we turn our back on
the community, our friendship with Jesus will grow cold. This is a fact,
and we must never forget it. Love for the brothers and sisters of our
communities -- religious, parochial, diocesan and others -- is a kind of
fuel that feeds our friendship with Jesus. Our acts of love for our
brothers and sisters in community may well be the best and, at times,
the only way that we can witness to others our love for Jesus Christ. He
himself said, "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if
you have love for one another" (*Jn* 13:35).

213\. This love then becomes service within the community. I never tire
of repeating that Jesus told us this in the clearest terms possible:
"Just as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it
to me" (*Mt* 25:40). He now asks you to meet him there, in every one of
our brothers and sisters, and especially in the poor, the despised and
the abandoned members of society. What a beautiful encounter that can
be!

214\. If we are concerned with helping others, this in no way means that
we are turning away from Jesus. Rather, we are encountering him in
another way. Whenever we try to help and care for another person, Jesus
is at our side. We should never forget that, when he sent his disciples
on mission, "the Lord worked with them" (*Mk* 16:20). He is always
there, always at work, sharing our efforts to do good. In a mysterious
way, his love becomes present through our service. He speaks to the
world in a language that at times has no need of words.

215\. Jesus is calling you and sending you forth to spread goodness in
our world. His call is one of service, a summons to do good, perhaps as
a physician, a mother, a teacher or a priest. Wherever you may be, you
can hear his call and realize that he is sending you forth to carry out
that mission. He himself told us, "I am sending you out" (*Lk* 10:3). It
is part of our being friends with him. For this friendship to mature,
however, it is up to you to let him send you forth on a mission in this
world, and to carry it out confidently, generously, freely and
fearlessly. If you stay trapped in your own comfort zone, you will never
really find security; doubts and fears, sorrow and anxiety will always
loom on the horizon. Those who do not carry out their mission on this
earth will find not happiness, but disappointment. Never forget that
Jesus is at your side at every step of the way. He will not cast you
into the abyss, or leave you to your own devices. He will always be
there to encourage and accompany you. He has promised, and he will do
it: "For I am with you always, to the end of the age" (*Mt* 28:20).

216\. In your own way, you too must be a missionary, like the apostles
and the first disciples of Jesus, who went forth to proclaim the love of
God, to tell others that Christ is alive and worth knowing. Saint
Therese experienced this as an essential part of her oblation to
merciful Love: "I wanted to give my Beloved to drink and I felt myself
consumed with a thirst for souls".[^227]
 That is your mission as well. Each of us must carry it out in
his or her own way; you will come to see how you can be a missionary.
Jesus deserves no less. If you accept the challenge, he will enlighten
you, accompany you and strengthen you, and you will have an enriching
experience that will bring you much happiness. It is not important
whether you see immediate results; leave that to the Lord who works in
the secret of our hearts. Keep experiencing the joy born of our efforts
to share the love of Christ with others.

# CONCLUSION

217\. The present document can help us see that the teaching of the
social Encyclicals *[Laudato
Si'](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html)*
and *[Fratelli
Tutti](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html)*
is not unrelated to our encounter with the love of Jesus Christ. For it
is by drinking of that same love that we become capable of forging bonds
of fraternity, of recognizing the dignity of each human being, and of
working together to care for our common home.

218\. In a world where everything is bought and sold, people's sense of
their worth appears increasingly to depend on what they can accumulate
with the power of money. We are constantly being pushed to keep buying,
consuming and distracting ourselves, held captive to a demeaning system
that prevents us from looking beyond our immediate and petty needs. The
love of Christ has no place in this perverse mechanism, yet only that
love can set us free from a mad pursuit that no longer has room for a
gratuitous love. Christ's love can give a heart to our world and revive
love wherever we think that the ability to love has been definitively
lost.

219\. The Church also needs that love, lest the love of Christ be
replaced with outdated structures and concerns, excessive attachment to
our own ideas and opinions, and fanaticism in any number of forms, which
end up taking the place of the gratuitous love of God that liberates,
enlivens, brings joy to the heart and builds communities. The wounded
side of Christ continues to pour forth that stream which is never
exhausted, never passes away, but offers itself time and time again to
all those who wish to love as he did. For his love alone can bring about
a new humanity.

220\. I ask our Lord Jesus Christ to grant that his Sacred Heart may
continue to pour forth the streams of living water that can heal the
hurt we have caused, strengthen our ability to love and serve others,
and inspire us to journey together towards a just, solidary and
fraternal world. Until that day when we will rejoice in celebrating
together the banquet of the heavenly kingdom in the presence of the
risen Lord, who harmonizes all our differences in the light that
radiates perpetually from his open heart. May he be blessed forever.

[^33]: We can thus understand why the
Church has forbidden placing on the altar representations of the heart
of Jesus or Mary alone (cf. Response of the Congregation of Sacred Rites
to the Reverend Charles Lecoq, P.S.S., 5 April 1879: *Decreta Authentica
Congregationis Sacrorum Rituum ex Actis ejusdem Collecta*, vol. III,
107-108, n. 3492). Outside the liturgy, "for private devotion" (ibid.),
the symbolism of a heart can be used as a teaching aid, an aesthetic
figure or an emblem that invites one to meditate on the love of Christ,
but this risks taking the heart as an object of adoration or spiritual
dialogue apart from the Person of Christ. On 31 March 1887, the
Congregation gave another, similar response (ibid., 187, n. 3673).

[^69]: "Since there is in the Sacred
Heart a symbol and the express image of the infinite love of Jesus
Christ that moves us to love one another, it is fit and proper that we
should consecrate ourselves to his most Sacred Heart -- an act that is
nothing else than an offering and a binding of oneself to Jesus Christ,
for whatever honour, veneration and love is given to this divine Heart
is really and truly given to Christ himself...And now, today, behold
another blessed and heavenly token is offered to our sight -- the most
Sacred Heart of Jesus, with a cross rising from it and shining forth
with dazzling splendour amidst flames of love. In that Sacred Heart all
our hopes should be placed, and from it the salvation of men is to be
confidently besought" (Encyclical Letter [*Annum
Sacrum*](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_25051899_annum-sacrum.html)
\[25 May 1899\]: ASS 31 \[1898-1899\], 649, 651).
 
 
[^70]: "For is not the sum of all religion and therefore the pattern 
  of more perfect life, contained in that most auspicious sign and in
  the form of piety that follows from it inasmuch as it more readily 
  leads the minds of men to an intimate knowledge of Christ our Lord, 
  and more efficaciously moves their hearts to love him more vehemently 
  and to imitate him more closely?"
  (Encyclical Letter [*Miserentissimus Redemptor*](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19280508_miserentissimus-redemptor.html)
\[8 May 1928\]: AAS 20 \[1928\], 167).
 
 
[^71]: "For it is perfectly clear that
this devotion, if we examine its proper nature, is a most excellent act
of religion, inasmuch as it demands the full and absolute determination
of surrendering and consecrating oneself to the love of the divine
Redeemer whose wounded heart is the living sign and symbol of that
love... In it, we can contemplate not only the symbol, but also, as it
were, the synthesis of the whole mystery of our redemption... Christ
expressly and repeatedly pointed to his heart as the symbol by which men
are drawn to recognize and acknowledge his love, and at the same time
constituted it as the sign and pledge of his mercy and his grace for the
needs of the Church in our time" (Encyclical Letter [*Haurietis
