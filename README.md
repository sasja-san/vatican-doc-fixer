# How To Use

Go to a document page on vatican.va, such as this:

<https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_20030417_eccl-de-euch.html>

Save the HTML file only. Then run

```cmd
$ vati-tufte.sh "Ecclesia de Eucharistia (17 April 2003) _ John Paul II.html"
```

If it all works out you will get a PDF output file that works well with printing, or easy screen reading (more reasonable line width etc.).
